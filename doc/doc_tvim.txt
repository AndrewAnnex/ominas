TVIM
----


 PURPOSE:
       Displays an image in an IDL window, sets display properties
       (zoom, offset and order) and maintains a data coordinate system for
       the window.


 CATEGORY:
       UTIL/TVIM


 CALLING SEQUENCE:
       tvim, arg1 <, arg2>


 ARGUMENTS:
  INPUT:
           arg1:     Can be window number if argument has 1 dimension, or
                     an image if argument has 2 dimensions.  If it's an image,
                     then that image is displayed.  If it's a window number,
                     then that window becomes the current window.

           arg2:     Same as above, either window number or image.
                     If no args are given, tvim prints the current window
                     number.

  OUTPUT:
       NONE

 KEYWORDS:
  INPUT:
         silent:     If set, supresses output of messages.

            new:     If set, creates a new window.

        inherit:     If set, window will inherit the settings of the
                     current tvim window.

          xsize:     Set the x size of the window to this amount.

          ysize:     Set the y size of the window to this amount.

            all:     If set, print all display properties (not implemented)

        default:     If set, use default properties (zoom=[1,1], offset=[0,0]
                     order=0 [bottom-up])

         entire:     If set, zoom and offset are set such that the entire 
                     image is visible in the current window.

       previous:     If set, restore last-used properties.

        restore:     If set, use saved properties.

           home:     If set, set the offset to [0,0].

        channel:     Display plane (1, 2, or 3) to display image in.

        doffset:     Change the offset property by this amount.

           save:     Save the current properties.

           zoom:     2-element array giving the zoom in each direction.

          order:     If set, y coordinate display order is top-down.

          rotate:    If set, coordinates are transformed as in the idl 
                     'rotate' command.

           flip:     If set, reverse display order.

         offset:     Set the corner of image for display to this value.

  local_scaling:     If set, pixel values are scaled based only on the 
		      pixel visible with the current tvim settings.

	no_scale:     If set, pixel values are not altered.

            top:     Set the top stretch value to this value.

          erase:     If set, erase the display window before displaying image.

         noplot:     If set, do all the calculations but do not display the
                     image.

         pixmap:     If set and if this is a new window, the window will 
                     be a pixmap.

    draw_pixmap:     If set, then the image will be written to this pixmap
                     and then copied to the main window.  If /no_copy,
                     then the image will not be copie to the main window.

        no_copy:     See the " draw_pixmap" keyword.

         retain:     "Retain" value to be passed to the IDL routine
                     widget_draw.

          title:     Title text for the window frame.

           bufz:     If set, the z-buffer is used.

    force_xsize:     If set, the window is forced to this x-size.

    force_ysize:     If set, the window is forced to this y-size.

          nowin:     If set, then no window is opened.

           list:     If set, the "wnum" keyword will return a list
                     valid tvim window numbers.

        no_wset:     If set, the window number is not changed.

       no_coord:     If set, the coordinate system is not changed.



  OUTPUT:
       wnum:		Window number of current tvim instance.

	get_info:	Returns the tvim data structure for the current
			window, see tvim_data__define below.

        tvimage:     The scaled image is returned by this keyword.

            min:      Minimum data value in each image plane.

            max:      Maximum data value in each image plane.
