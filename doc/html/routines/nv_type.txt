NV_TYPE


 PURPOSE:
	Returns the type code associated with a data descriptor.  


 CATEGORY:
	NV/SYS


 CALLING SEQUENCE:
	type = nv_type(dd)


 ARGUMENTS:
  INPUT:
	dd:	Data descriptor.

  OUTPUT: NONE


 KEYWORDS:
  INPUT: NONE

  OUTPUT: NONE


 RETURN: 
	Integer giving the type.


 STATUS:
	This data descriptor functonality is not complete.  A 'type' field
 	needs to be added to the input functions similar to the 'dim' field.
	Then nv_read would include that argument in its call to input_fn and
	it should work.
