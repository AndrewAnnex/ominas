NV_GET_VALUE


 PURPOSE:
	Calls input translators, supplying the given keyword, and builds 
	a list of  returned values.


 CATEGORY:
	NV/SYS


 CALLING SEQUENCE:
	values = nv_get_value(dd, keyword)


 ARGUMENTS:
  INPUT:
	dd:		Data descriptor.

	keyword:	Keyword to pass to translators, describing the
			requested quantity.

  OUTPUT: NONE


 KEYWORDS:
  INPUT: 
	trs:		Transient argument string.

	tr_disable:	If set, nv_get_value returns without performing 
			any action.

	tr_override:	Comma-delimited list of translators to use instead
			of those stored in dd.

	tr_first:	If set, nv_get_value returns after the first
			successful translator.

  OUTPUT: 
	status:		0 if at least one translator call was successful, 
			-1 otherwise.


 RETURN: 
	Array of values returned from all successful translator calls.
	Values are returned in the same order that the corresponding 
	translators were called.  The dimensions are determined by the 
	output of the first translator call.  Dimensions are (dim,n_values),
	where n_objects is the total number of returned values (there may
	be more than one per translator), and dim is the dimensions of 
	each value.  If dim == 1, the dimensions of the nv_get_value result
	are (n_values).


 STATUS:
	Complete
