PG_GET_ARRAYS


 PURPOSE:
	Obtains a array descriptor for the given data descriptor.  


 CATEGORY:
	NV/PG


 CALLING SEQUENCE:
	result = pg_get_arrays(dd)
	result = pg_get_arrays(dd, trs)


 ARGUMENTS:
  INPUT:
	dd:	data descriptor

	trs:	String containing keywords and values to be passed directly
		to the translators as if they appeared as arguments in the
		translators table.  These arguments are passed to every
		translator called, so the user should be aware of possible
		conflicts.  Keywords passed using this mechanism take 
		precedence over keywords appearing in the translators table.

  OUTPUT: NONE


 KEYWORDS:
  INPUT:
	no_sort:	Unless this keyword is set, only the first descriptor 
			encountered with a given name is returned.  This allows
			translators to be arranged in the translators table such
			by order of priority.

	override:	Create a data descriptor and initilaize with the 
			given values.  Translators will not be called.

	arr_*:		All array override keywords are accepted.  See
			array_keywords.include. 

			If arr_name is specified, then only descriptors with
			those names are returned.

	verbatim:	If set, the descriptors requested using arr_name
			are returned in the order requested.  Otherwise, the 
			order is determined by the translators.

	tr_override:	String giving a comma-separated list of translators
			to use instead of those in the translators table.  If
			this keyword is specified, no translators from the 
			table are called, but the translators keywords
			from the table are still used.  


 RETURN:
	Array of array descriptors, 0 if an error occurs.


 PROCEDURE:
	If /override, then a array descriptor is created and initialized
	using the specified values.  Otherwise, the descriptor is obtained
	through the translators.  Note that if /override is not used,
	values (except arr_name) can still be overridden by specifying 
	them as keyword parameters.  If arr_name is specified, then
	only descriptors corresponding to those names will be returned.
