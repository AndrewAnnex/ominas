NV_WRITE


 PURPOSE:
	Writes a data file of arbitrary format.


 CATEGORY:
	NV/SYS


 CALLING SEQUENCE:
	nv_write, filespec, dd


 ARGUMENTS:
  INPUT:
	filespec:	Array of strings giving file specifications for
			file to write.

	dd:		Array of data descriptors.

  OUTPUT: NONE


 KEYWORDS:
  INPUT:
	filetype:	Overrides data descriptor filetype (and thus the 
			output function).

	output_fn:	Overrides data descriptor output function.

	verbose:	If set, message are enabled.


  OUTPUT: NONE


 RETURN: NONE


 RESTRICTIONS:
	Under unix, the IDL findfile routine does not expand the ~ symbol,
	but openr does.  In order to salvage some functionality, nv_read 
	allows filespecs to pass even if they don't expand to anything using
	findfile.  In this way, a filespec contianing ~ can be properly
	expanded, but only if it expands to one filename.  If it expands
	to multiple filenames, then openr will choke on it.


 PROCEDURE:
	nv_write expands all file specifications and attempts to write a
	file corresponding to each given data descriptor.  An error results
	if the filespec expands to a different number of files than the number
	of given data descriptors. 


 STATUS:
	Complete
