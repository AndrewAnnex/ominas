PG_CNTRD


 PURPOSE:
	Calculates the centroids centered near given features in
	an image.


 CATEGORY:
	NV/PG


 CALLING SEQUENCE:
	result = pg_cntrd(dd, object_ps)


 ARGUMENTS:
  INPUT:
	dd:		Data descriptor

	object_ps: 	Array (n_pts) of pg_points_struct giving the points.
			Only the image coordinates of the points need to be
			specified.

  OUTPUT:
       NONE

 KEYWORDS:
  INPUT:

       fwhm:           Full-Width Half-maximum to use around expected point
                       location.  If not given, a default fwhm of 2 pixels
                       is used.

       edge:           Distance from edge from which to ignore points.  If
                       not given, an edge distance of 0 is used.

     sigmin:           If given, points are discarded if the sigma above 
                       the mean for the centroid pixel is below this value.


  OUTPUT: NONE


 RETURN:
	An array of type pg_points_struct giving the detected position for
       each object.  The max values for each detection is
       saved in the data portion of pg_points_struct with tag 'scan_cc'.
       The x and y offset from the given position is also saved.


 RESTRICTIONS:
	Currently does not work for multiple time steps.


 PROCEDURE:
	For each visible object, a centroid is calcualted using the
	astronlib cntrd routine.

 STATUS:
	Complete.
