ILLUMINATION_FRACTION


 PURPOSE:
	Assuming the body gbx is a sphere, this routine computes the fraction of 
	its disk that appears illuminated by the source sund, as seen from the
	inertial position vectors v.


 CATEGORY:
       NV/LIB/TOOLS


 CALLING SEQUENCE:
       v = illumination_fraction(gbx, sund, v)


 ARGUMENTS:
  INPUT:
	gbx:	Any subclass of GLOBE.

	sund:	Any subclass of STAR representing the sun.

	v:	Array (nv,3) Inertial positions of viewer.

  OUTPUT:
       NONE


 KEYOWRDS:
  INPUT: NONE

  OUTPUT: NONE


 RETURN: 
	Array (nv) giving the illumination fraction for each gbx.
