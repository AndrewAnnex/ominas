PG_PTSCAN_COEFF


 PURPOSE:
	Computes linear least-squares coefficients for a fit to the image
	coordinate offset which matches a point to a feature in an image.


 CATEGORY:
	NV/PG


 CALLING SEQUENCE:
	result = pg_ptscan_coeff(pts_ps)


 ARGUMENTS:
  INPUT:
       pts_ps:         Array (n_pts) of pg_points_struct output from
                       pg_ptscan containing image points as well as
                       other necessary data.;

  OUTPUT: NONE


 KEYWORDS:
  INPUT:
       axis_ps:        pg_points_struct containing a single image point
                       to be used as the axis of rotation in the fit for
                       every point.

       fix:            Array specifying which parameters to fix in the
                       fit as [dx,dy,dtheta].; 

  OUTPUT: NONE

 RETURN:
       Array (n_pts) of pg_fit_coeff_struct containing coefficients for
       the least-square fit to be input to pg_fit.


 PROCEDURE:
       pg_ptscan_coeff extracts the scan data from the given
       scan_ps structure and uses ipt_coeff to compute the coefficients.
       See the documentation for that routine for details.


 EXAMPLE:
       The following command uses data from pg_ptscan to compute
       least square coefficients for a fit such that only dx and dtheta
       will be allowed to vary:

       optic_ps={pg_points_struct}
       optic_ps=pgs_set_points(optic_ps, points=cam_oaxis(cd))
       ptscan_cf = pg_ptscan_coeff(pts_ps, axis=optic_ps, fix=[1])

       In this call, pts_ps is a pg_points_struct containing the point data
       from pg_ptscan and optic_ps is a pg_points_struct giving the optic axis
       of the camera as computed by cam_oaxis.


 STATUS:
	Complete.
