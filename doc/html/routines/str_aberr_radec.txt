STR_ABERR_RADEC


 PURPOSE:
	Corrects star positions for stellar aberration due to the velocity
	of the observer.

	Star catalogues are compiled for a reference frame in which the 
	Sun (or alternately the Solar System Barycenter or SSB) is 
	stationary.  For an observer moving at a large velocity wrt the
	SSB, a correction must be done.  Let v be the observer's velocity.
	If omega is the angle between the observer's velocity vector and 
	the vector pointing towards the star, then v*sin(omega) is the 
	component of the observer's velocity that is tangential to the 
	star's position.  To transform the starlight's velocity vector
	from the SSB-stationary frame into the observer's frame, this
	velocity must be vector-subtracted from the starlight's vector.
	The result is the starlight's path as observed in the observer's
	frame, which is deflected by an angle phi (the angle at the
	bottom of the triangle below).  Since, according to Special
	Relativity, the velocity of light is c = 3e8 m/s in all frames,
	the hypoteneuse of the triangle below (representing the light's
	path in the observer's frame) has a vector magnitude of c.

	Therefore, we arrive at an expression for the deflection angle:

		sin(phi) = v*sin(omega) / c
