PG_CENTER


 PURPOSE:
	Computes image coordinates of the center of each object.


 CATEGORY:
	NV/PG


 CALLING SEQUENCE:
	center_ps = pg_center(cd=cd, bx=bx)
	center_ps = pg_center(gd=gd)


 ARGUMENTS:
  INPUT: NONE

  OUTPUT: NONE


 KEYWORDS:
  INPUT:
	cd:	Array (n_timesteps) of camera descriptors.

	bx:	Array (n_objects, n_timesteps) of descriptors of objects 
		which must be a subclass of BODY.

	gd:	Generic descriptor.  If given, the cd and bx inputs 
		are taken from the cd and bx fields of this structure
		instead of from those keywords.

	fov:	 If set points are computed only within this many camera
		 fields of view.

	cull:	 If set, points structures excluded by the fov keyword
		 are not returned.  Normally, empty points structures
		 are returned as placeholders.

  OUTPUT: NONE


 RETURN:
	Array (n_objects) of pg_points_struct containing image points and
	the corresponding inertial vectors.


 STATUS:
	Complete
