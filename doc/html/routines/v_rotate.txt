V_ROTATE


 PURPOSE:
       Rotates the (N,3) column vectors, v, about the (N,3) column vectors,
       n, by the angles theta.  The sin and cos of theta are given in
       order to improve performance.


 CATEGORY:
       UTIL/V


 CALLING SEQUENCE:
       result = v_rotate(v, n, sin_theta, cos_theta)


 ARGUMENTS:
  INPUT:
               v:      An array of N column vectors

               n:      An array of N column vectors

       sin_theta:      Sine of rotation angle theta

       cos_theta:      Cosine of rotation angle theta


  OUTPUT:
       NONE

 RETURN:
       If the arguments have dimensions v(N,3), n(N,3) and sin_theta(M),
       cos_theta(M) then the result has dimensions (N,3,M)


 RESTRICTIONS:
       v and n must have exactly the same dimensions.
       sin_theta and cos_theta must be 1-dimensional arrays of any length
       as long as the lengths are the same.  Note that if only one theta
       is specified, the arguments must be given as [sin_theta], [cos_theta]
       instead of as scalars.

 STATUS:
       Completed.
