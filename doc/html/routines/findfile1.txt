FINDFILE1


 PURPOSE:
       A more flexible version of the IDL routine findfile.


 CATEGORY:
       UTIL


 CALLING SEQUENCE:
       result = findfile1(filespec)


 ARGUMENTS:
  INPUT:
       filespec:       A filename that may contain the ~ symbol.

  OUTPUT:
       NONE

 RETURN:
       Array of found filenames.

 PROCEDURE:
       Under unix, the IDL findfile routine does not expand the ~ symbol,
       but openr does.  In order to salvage some functionality, findfile1
       allows filespecs to pass even if they don't expand to anything using
       findfile.  In this way, a filespec containing ~ can be properly
       expanded usng openr, but only if it expands to one filename.  If it
       expands to multiple filenames, then openr will choke on it.

	UPDATE 8/22/2012: Under idl 7.0, the '~' symbol is expanded by 
	findfile.

 STATUS:
       Completed.
