INGRID


 PURPOSE:
	INterface to GRIm Data -- command-line access to grim data.


 CATEGORY:
	NV/GR


 CALLING SEQUENCE:
	ingrid, gd=gd


 ARGUMENTS:
  INPUT:
	grnum:	Grim window number.  If not given, the most recently accessed
	        grim instance is used.

  OUTPUT: NONE


 KEYWORDS:
  INPUT:
	pn:	Plane numer(s) to access.  If not given, then current plane
		is used.

	all:	If set, all planes are used.

  OUTPUT:
	dd:	Grim's data descriptor.

	cd:	Grim's camera descriptor.

	pd:	Grim's planet descriptors.

	rd:	Grim's ring descriptors.

	sd:	Grim's star descriptors.

	sund:	Grim's sun descriptor.

	od:	Grim's observer descriptor.

	cd:	Grim's camera descriptor.

	gd:	Generic descriptor containing all of the above descriptors. 

	limb_ps:	pg_points_struct giving the limb points.

	ring_ps:	pg_points_struct giving the ring points.

	star_ps:	pg_points_struct giving the star points.

	term_ps:	pg_points_struct giving the terminator points.

	plgrid_ps:	pg_points_struct giving teh planet grid points.

	center_ps:	pg_points_struct giving the planet centers.

	object_ps:	pg_points_struct giving all overlay points.

	tie_ps:		pg_points_struct giving the tie points.


 PROCEDURE:
	The returned descriptors allow direct access to the memory images of
	grim's descriptor set.  Therefore changes made from the command line
	affect the descriptors that grim is using.  Moreover, grim monitors
	those descriptors and updates itself whenever a change occurs.  


 EXAMPLE:
	(1) Open a grim window, load an image, and compute limb points.

	(2) At the command line:

		IDL> ingrid, cd=cd
		IDL> pg_repoint, [50,50], 0d, cd=cd

	Grim should detect the change to the camera descriptor and update
	itself by recomputing the limb points.


 STATUS:
	Complete
