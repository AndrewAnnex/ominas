HIST_2D

 PURPOSE:
	Return the density function (histogram) of two variables.

 CATEGORY:
	Image processing, statistics, probability.

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
	Result = hist_2d(V1, V2)
 INPUTS:
	V1 and V2 = arrays containing the variables.  May be any non-complex
		numeric type.

 Keyword Inputs:
       MIN1:   MIN1 is the minimum V1 value to consider. If this
               keyword is not specified, then V1 si searched for 
		its smallest value.

       MIN2:   MIN2 is the minimum V2 value to consider. If this
               keyword is not specified, then V2 si searched for 
		its smallest value.

       MAX1:   MAX1 is the maximum V1 value to consider. If this
               keyword is not specified, then V1 is searched for
               its largest value.

       MAX2    MAX2 is the maximum V2 value to consider. If this
               keyword is not specified, then V2 is searched for
               its largest value.

       BIN1    The size of each bin in the V1 direction (column
               width).  If this keyword is not specified, the
               size is set to 1.

       BIN2    The size of each bin in the V2 direction (row
               height).  If this keyword is not specified, the
               size is set to 1.

 OUTPUTS:
	The two dimensional density function of the two variables,
	a longword array of dimensions (m1, m2), where:
		m1 = Floor((max1-min1)/bin1) + 1
	   and  m2 = Floor((max2-min2)/bin2) + 1
	and Result(i,j) is equal to the number of sumultaneous occurences
	of an element of V1 falling in the ith bin, with the same element
	of V2 falling in the jth bin, where:
		i = (v1 < max1 - min1 > 0) / b1
	   and  j = (v2 < max2 - min2 > 0) / b2

	Note: elements larger than the max or smaller than the min are
	truncated to the max and min, respectively.

 COMMON BLOCKS:
	None.
 SIDE EFFECTS:
	None.
 RESTRICTIONS:
	Not usable with complex or string data.
 PROCEDURE:
	Creates a combines array from the two variables, equal to the
	linear subscript in the resulting 2D histogram, then applies
	the standard histogram function.

 EXAMPLE:
	Return the 2D histogram of two byte images:
		R = HIST_2D(image1, image2)

	Return the 2D histogram made from two floating point images
	with range of -1 to +1, and with 101 (= 2/.02 + 1) bins:
		R = HIST_2D(f1, f2, MIN1=-1, MIN2=-1, MAX1=1, MAX2=1, $
			BIN1=.02, BIN2=.02)

				suggestion of Kevin Trupie, GSC, NASA/GSFC.
	Spitale, Jun 2002	Added reverse_indices keyword
