PG_RAY


 PURPOSE:
	Computes image points on each specified ray.


 CATEGORY:
	NV/PG


 CALLING SEQUENCE:
	ray_ps = pg_ray(cd=cd, r=r, v=v)


 ARGUMENTS:
  INPUT: NONE

  OUTPUT: NONE


 KEYWORDS:
  INPUT:
	cd:	 Array (nt) of camera descriptors.

	bx:	 Array (nt) of body descriptors to be used for transforming
		 the points instead of the camera descriptor.  Use this
		 input if cd is a map.

	r:	 Array (nv,3,nt) of inertial vectors giving the starting
		 point for each ray.

	v:	 Array (nv,3,nt) of inertial unit vectors giving the direction
		 for each ray.

	len:	 Array (nv,nt) giving the length for each ray.  Lengths 
		 default to 1 if not given.

	gd:	 Generic descriptor.  If given, the cd input 
		 is taken from the cd field of this structure
		 instead of from that keyword.

	npoints: Number of points to compute.  Default is 1000.

	fov:	 If set points are computed only within this many camera
		 fields of view.

	cull:	 If set, points structures excluded by the fov keyword
		 are not returned.  Normally, empty points structures
		 are returned as placeholders.

	cat:	 If set, all points for each descriptor are concatenated
		 into a single array of nv*npoints points.

  OUTPUT: NONE


 RETURN:
	Array (nt) of pg_points_struct each containing image
	points (2,nv,npoints) and the corresponding inertial vectors 
	(nv,3,npoints).
