PG_TO_SURFACE


 PURPOSE:
       Converts image coordinates to surface coordinates.  Input
       array can be array of image points or a pg_points_struct.


 CATEGORY:
	NV/PG


 CALLING SEQUENCE:
       result = pg_to_surface(image_points, cd=cd, gbx=gbx) 
       result = pg_to_surface(image_points, gd=gd)


 ARGUMENTS:
  INPUT:
        image_points:     Array (n_points) of image points (x,y) or
                          array of type pg_points_struct.

  OUTPUT:
       NONE


 KEYWORDS:
  INPUT:
                  cd:     Array (n_timesteps) of camera descriptors.

                 gbx:     Array (n_objects, n_timesteps) of descriptors of
                          objects that must be a subclass of GLOBE.

                  gd:     Generic descriptor.  If given, the cd and gbx
                          inputs are taken from the cd and gbx fields of 
                          this structure instead of from those keywords.

                  ps:     If set, image_points is treated as a structure
                          of type pg_points_struct.

  OUTPUT:
        NONE


 RETURN:
	Array (n_points) of surface points.


 STATUS:
	Complete
