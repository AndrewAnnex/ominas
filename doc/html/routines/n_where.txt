N_WHERE


 PURPOSE:
       Finds subscripts where an element in the first array matches
       elements in the second input array.  This routine differs
	from nwhere in that 1) it works as advertised, and 2) it uses
	array operations for a faster search.  Also, this routine
	works only for numeric types.

       UTIL
