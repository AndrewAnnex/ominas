SPICE_OUTPUT


 PURPOSE:
	Generic NAIF/SPICE output translator core.  This routine is not a 
	OMINAS output translator; it is intended to be called by an output
	translator that is taylored to a specific mission.  This routine 
	works only for camera descriptors.


 CATEGORY:
	NV/CONFIG


 CALLING SEQUENCE:
	spice_output, dd, keyword, value, prefix


 ARGUMENTS:
  INPUT:
	dd:		Data descriptor.

	keyword:	String giving the name of the translator quantity.
			Only 'CAM_DESCRIPTORS' is recognized and the routine
			[prefix]_spice_write_cameras is called.

	value:		The data to write.

	prefix:		String giving a prefix to use in contructing the names
			of the input function:

			  [prefix]_spice_write_cameras

			This function is a wrapper that prepares the relevant
			inputs for a specific mission and calls
			spice_write_cameras to write a C-kernel.  See
			cas_spice_output for an example of how to write such
			a function.

  OUTPUT:
	NONE


 KEYWORDS:
  INPUT:
	key1:		Camera descriptor.

  OUTPUT:
	status:		Zero unless a problem occurs.


  TRANSLATOR KEYWORDS:
	ref:		Name of the reference frame for the input quantities.
			Default is 'j2000'.

	j2000:		/j2000 is equivalent to specifying ref=j2000.

	b1950:		/b1950 is equivalent to specifying ref=b1950.

	klist:		Name of a file giving a list of SPICE kernels to use.
			If no path is included, the path is taken from the 
			NV_SPICE environment variable.

	ck_out:		String giving the name of the new C-kernel to write.

	reload:		If set, new kernels are loaded, as specified by the
			klist keyword.


  ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES:
	NV_SPICE_KER:	Directory containing the kernel list file.


 STATUS:
	Complete
