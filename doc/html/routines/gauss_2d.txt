GAUSS_2D


 PURPOSE:
       Generates an array containing a 2-dimensional gaussian


 CATEGORY:
       UTIL


 CALLING SEQUENCE:
       result = gauss_2d(x0, y0, w, xsize, ysize)


 ARGUMENTS:
  INPUT:
          x0:  x position of center of gaussian

          y0:  y position of center of gaussian

           w:  half-width of gaussian; i.e., the distance at which the value
		is 1/e times that at the peak.

       xsize:  size of output array in x

       ysize:  size of output array in y

  OUTPUT:
       NONE


 RETURN:
       An array (xsize,ysize) containing a gaussian of width w centered
       centered at position (x0,y0)


 STATUS:
       Completed.
