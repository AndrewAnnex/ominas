NV_DATA


 PURPOSE:
	Returns the data array associated with a data descriptor.


 CATEGORY:
	NV/SYS


 CALLING SEQUENCE:
	data = nv_data(dd)


 ARGUMENTS:
  INPUT:
	dd:	Data descriptor.

  OUTPUT: NONE


 KEYWORDS:
  INPUT: 
	samples:  Samping indices.  If set, only these data elements are
		  returned.  May be 1D or the same number of dimensions as
		  the data array.   

	nd:       If set, the samples input is taken to be an ND coordinate
	          rather than a 1D subscript.  nv_data can normally tell
	          the difference automatically, but there is an ambiguity
	          if a single ND point is requested.  In that case, nv_data
	          interprets that as an array of 1D subscripts, unless /nd
	          is set.

	true:     If set, the actual data array is returned, even if there is
	          a sampling function.

  OUTPUT: NONE


 RETURN:
	The data array associated with the data descriptor.


 STATUS:
	Complete
