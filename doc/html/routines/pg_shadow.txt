PG_SHADOW


 PURPOSE:
	Computes image coordinates of given inertial vectors projected onto
	surface of the given disks and globes with respect to the given
	observer.  Returns only the closest shadow point for each objoect 
	point.


 CATEGORY:
	NV/PG


 CALLING SEQUENCE:
	pg_shadow, object_ps, cd=cd, ods=ods, dkx=dkx, gbx=gbx


 ARGUMENTS:
  INPUT:
	object_ps:	Array of pg_points_struct containing inertial vectors.

  OUTPUT: NONE


 KEYWORDS:
  INPUT:
	cd:	Array (n_timesteps) of camera descriptors.

	gbx:	Array (n_globes, n_timesteps) of descriptors of objects 
		which must be a subclass of GLOBE.

	dkx:	Array (n_disks, n_timesteps) of descriptors of objects 
		which must be a subclass of DISK.

	bx:	Array (n_disks, n_timesteps) of descriptors of objects 
		which must be a subclass of BODY.

	od:	Array (n_timesteps) of descriptors of objects 
		which must be a subclass of BODY.  These objects are used
		as the source from which points are projected.  If no observer
		descriptor is given, then the sun descriptor in gd is used.
		Only one observer is allowed.

	gd:	Generic descriptor.  If given, the cd, dkx, gbx, and bx inputs 
		are taken from the corresponding fields of this structure
		instead of from those keywords.

	  All other keywords are passed directly to pg_shadow_globe
	  and pg_shadow_disk and are documented with those programs.

  OUTPUT: NONE


 RETURN: 
	Array (n_disks,n_objects) of pg_points_struct containing image 
	points and the corresponding inertial vectors.
