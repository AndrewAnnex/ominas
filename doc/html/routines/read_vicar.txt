	data = read_vicar(filename, label)


 ARGUMENTS:
  INPUT:
	filename:	String giving the name of the file to be read.

  OUTPUT:
	label:		Named variable in which the vicar label will be
			returned.


 KEYWORDS:
  INPUT:
	n_l:	If set, this will override the number of lines given by the 
		'NL' field of the label.	

	n_s:	If set, this will override the number of samples given by the 
		'NS' field of the label.

	n_b:	If set, this will override the number of bands given by the 
		'NB' field of the label.

	nlb:	If set, this will override the number of binary header records
		given by the 'NLB' field of the label.

	nbb:	If set, this will override the number of binary prefix bytes
		given by the 'NBB' field of the label.

	silent:	If set, no messages are printed.

	swap:	If set, the data array will be byte-swapped.  If not set,
		then read_vicar will automatically determine whether 
		to byte swapping is necessary.

	flip:	If set, the data array will be subjected to a rotate(data, 7),
		i.e., if its an image, it will be flipped vertically.

	default_format:	Data format to use if not given in the label.
			choices are 'BYTE', 'HALF', 'FULL", 'REAL', and
			'DOUB'.  default is 'BYTE'.

       bpa:    Binary Prefix Array.  The caller must ensure that this array
		has appropriate dimensions.

	bha:	Binary Header Array.  The caller must ensure that this array
		has appropriate dimensions.

  OUTPUT:
	status:	If no errors occur, status will be zero, otherwise
		it will be a string giving an error message.


 RETURN:
	The data array read from the file.


 RESTRICTIONS:
	This program only works with band-sequential data.  If EOL present,
	the EOL variable is returned as 0, the second LBLSIZE is erased
	and the first LBLSIZE is adjusted to appear as if the label was
	not split in two.


 STATUS:
	Complete
