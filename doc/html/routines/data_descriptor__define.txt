DATA_DESCRIPTOR__DEFINE


 PURPOSE:
	Structure defining the data descriptor.


 CATEGORY:
	NV/SYS


 CALLING SEQUENCE:
	N/A 


 FIELDS:
	id_string:	Identification string.  Typically the filename.

	sn:	Serial number.  This functionality has been replaced
		by the ID pointer, but it is still maintained.

	idp:	ID pointer.  This pointer is unique to the descriptor
		and can be used for identification.

	data_dap:	Pointer to data archive containing the data 
			and nhist past versions.

	dap_index:	Index of archived data to use.  

	max:		Maximum data value.

	min:		Minimum data value.

	dim_p:	Pointer to array giving data dimensions.

	type:	Data type code.

	filename:	Name of data file.

	filetype:	Filetype string determined by nv_detect_filetype.

	input_transforms_p:	Pointer to list of input transform 
				functions determined by nv_lookup_transforms.

	output_transforms_p:	Pointer to list of output transform 
				functions determined by nv_lookup_transforms.

	input_fn:	Name of function to read data file.

	output_fn:	Name of function to write data file.

	keyword_fn:	Name of function to read/write header keywords.

	instrument:	Instrument string from nv_detect_instrument.

	input_translators_p:	Pointer to list of input translator 
				functions determined by nv_lookup_translators.

	output_translators_p:	Pointer to list of output translator 
				functions determined by nv_lookup_translators.

	input_keyvals_p:	Keyword/value pairs for input translators.

	output_keyvals_p:	Keyword/value pairs for output translators.

	transient_keyvals_p:	Transient keyword/value pairs found in the 
				translator argument string.

	last_translator:	Description of last translator called.

	sampling_fn:		Optional function to perform a transformation
				on the samples given to nv_data():

				function sampling_fn, dd, samples, data

	sampling_fn_data_p:	Pointer to data for sampling_fn.

	dim_fn:			Optional function to cause nv_dim() to report
				dimensions other than those stored in the
				data descriptor:

				function dim_fn, dd, data

	dim_fn_data_p:		Pointer to data for dim_fn.

	compress:	Compression suffix.  The full name of the 
			compression function is nv_compress_data_<suffix>.

	compress_data_p:	Data for compression function.

	maintain:	Data maintenance mode:
				  0: load initially
				  1: load when needed; retain
				     only ndd data descriptor
				     arrays in memory.
				  2: Load when needed, but
 				     do not retain.

	update:		Data update mode:
				 -1: Locked; applies to data, header,
				     and udata.
				  0: Normal
				  1: Clone off a new descriptor 
				     and leave original dd
				     unchanged.

	sibling_dd_h:	Handle giving dd spawned as a result of writing to 
			this descriptor while update = 1.  Handle is used 
			to protect this dd from nv_free.

	udata_tlp:	Pointer to tag list containing user data.
