GRIM_MENU_VIEW_ZOOM_1_8_EVENT


 PURPOSE:
	Obtains the necessary descriptors through the translators and computes
	shadows of the currently active overlay points on all other objects. 
	Note that you may have todisable overlay hiding in order to compute
	and activate all of the appropriate source points for the shadows
	since many point that are not visible to the observer may still have
	a line of sight to the sun.
