PG_SHADOW_DISK


 PURPOSE:
	Computes image coordinates of given inertial vectors projected onto
	surface of the given disk with respect to the given observer.


 CATEGORY:
	NV/PG


 CALLING SEQUENCE:
	result = pg_shadow_disk(object_ps, cd=cd, ods=ods, dkx=dkx)


 ARGUMENTS:
  INPUT:
	object_ps:	Array of pg_points_struct containing inertial vectors.

  OUTPUT: NONE


 KEYWORDS:
  INPUT:
	cd:	Array (n_timesteps) of camera descriptors.

	dkx:	Array (n_disks, n_timesteps) of descriptors of objects 
		which must be a subclass of DISK.

	od:	Array (n_timesteps) of descriptors of objects 
		which must be a subclass of BODY.  These objects are used
		as the source from which points are projected.  If no observer
		descriptor is given, then the sun descriptor in gd is used.
		Only one observer is allowed.

	gd:	Generic descriptor.  If given, the cd and gbx inputs 
		are taken from the cd and gbx fields of this structure
		instead of from those keywords.

	reveal:	 Normally, disks whose opaque flag is set are ignored.  
		 /reveal suppresses this behavior.

	fov:	 If set shadow points are cropped to within this many camera
		 fields of view.

	cull:	 If set, points structures excluded by the fov keyword
		 are not returned.  Normally, empty points structures
		 are returned as placeholders.

   backshadow:	 If set, only backshadows (shadows cast between the object and
 		 observer) are returned.

	both:	 If set, both shadows and backshadows are returned.

	all:	 If set, all points are returned, even if invalid.

  OUTPUT: NONE


 RETURN: 
	Array (n_disks,n_objects) of pg_points_struct containing image 
	points and the corresponding inertial vectors.
