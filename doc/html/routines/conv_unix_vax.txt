 CALLING SEQUENCE:
	writefits, filename, data [,header]


 ARGUMENTS:
  INPUT:
	filename:	String containing the name of the file to be written.

	data:		Image array to be written to FITS file.

	header:		String array containing the header for the FITS file.
			If variable HEADER is not given, the program will
			generate a minimal FITS header.

  OUTPUT: NONE


 KEYWORDS:
  INPUT:
	NaNvalue:	Value in the data array to be set to the IEEE NaN
			condition.  This is the FITS representation of undefined
 			values.

	silent:		If set, suppress superfluous printed output.

  OUTPUT: NONE


 RETURN: NONE


 RESTRICTIONS:
       (1) It recommended that BSCALE and BZERO not be used (or set equal

       (2) WRITEFITS will remove any group parameters from the FITS header.
	(3) Does not handle groups or extensions.


 EXAMPLE:
       Write a randomn 50 x 50 array as a FITS file creating a minimal header.

       IDL> im = randomn(seed, 50, 50)        ;Create array
       IDL> writefits, 'test', im             ;Write to a FITS file "test"
