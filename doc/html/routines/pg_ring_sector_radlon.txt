PG_RING_SECTOR_RADLON

 PURPOSE:
	Constructs a ring sector outline for use with pg_profile_ring given
	radius and longitude bounds.
 
 CATEGORY:
       NV/PG

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
     outline_ps=pg_ring_sector_radlon(cd=cd, dkx=dkx, gbx=gbx, rad, lon)


 ARGUMENTS:
  INPUT:
      rad:	2-element array giving the lower and upper radial bounds
		for the sector.

      lon:	2-elements array giving the lower and upper longitude bounds
		for the sector in radians.

  OUTPUT:
	NONE



 KEYWORDS:
  INPUT: 
           cd:     Camera descriptor.

	   dkx:     Disk descriptor describing the ring.

          gbx:     Globe descriptor giving the primary for the ring.

           gd:     Generic descriptor containnig the above descriptors.

       sample:     Sets the grid sampling in pixels.  Default is one.

         nlon:     Total number of samples in the longitude direction.  
                   Determined by the 'sample' keyword by default.

         nrad:     Total number of samples in the radial direction.  
                   Determined by the 'sample' keyword by default.

        slope:     This keyword allows the longitude to vary as a function 
                   of radius as: lon = slope*(rad - rad0).

        nodsk:     If set, image points will not be included in the output 
                   pg_points_struct.

  OUTPUT:
         NONE


 RETURN: 
      pg_points_struct containing points on the sector outline.  The point
      spacing is determined by the sample keyword.  The points structure
      also contains the disk coordinate for each point and the user fields
      'nrad' and 'nlon' giving the number of points in radius and longitude.
