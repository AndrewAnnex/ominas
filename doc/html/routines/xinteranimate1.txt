XINTERANIMATE1

 PURPOSE:
	Display an animated sequence of images using X-windows Pixmaps.
	The speed and direction of the display can be adjusted using
	the widget interface.

 CATEGORY:
	Image display, widgets.

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
	To initialize:
		XINTERANIMATE1, SET = [Sizex, Sizey, Nframes]

	To load a single image:
		XINTERANIMATE1, IMAGE = Image, FRAME = Frame_Index

	To load a single image that is already displayed in an existing window:
		XINTERANIMATE1, FRAME = Frame_index, $
			WINDOW = [Window_Number [, X0, Y0, Sx, Sy]]
	(This technique is much faster than reading back from the window.)

	To display the animation after all the images have been loaded:
		XINTERANIMATE1 [, Rate]

	To close and deallocate the pixmap/buffer (which also takes place
	automatically when the user presses the "Done With Animation"
	button or closes the window with the window manager):
		XINTERANIMATE1, /CLOSE

 OPTIONAL INPUTS:
	Rate:	A value between 0 and 100 that represents the speed of the
		animation as a percentage of the maximum display rate.
		The fastest animation is with a value of 100 and the slowest
		is with a value of 0.  The default animation rate is 100.
		The animation must be initialized using the SET
		keyword before calling XINTERANIMATE1 with a rate value.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
	CLOSE:	Set this keyword to delete the offscreen pixwins and Widget,
		freeing storage.

	CYCLE: If set, cycle.  Normally, frames are displayed going either
		forward or backwards.  If CYCLE is set, reverse direction
		after the last frame in either direction is displayed.
		Provide this keyword with the SET keyword.

	FRAME:	The frame number when loading frames.  This keyword only has
		an effect when used in conjunction with the SET keyword.
		FRAME must be set to a number in the range 0 to Nframes-1.

	GROUP:	The widget ID of the widget that calls XINTERANIMATE1.  When
		this ID is specified, the death of the caller results in the
		death of XINTERANIMATE1.

	IMAGE:	A single image to be loaded at the animation position given
		by FRAME.  The keyword parameter FRAME must also be specified.

	KEEP_PIXMAPS: If TRUE, XINTERANIMATE1 doesn't destroy the animation
		pixmaps when it is killed. Calling it again without
		going through the SET and LOAD steps will cause the same
		animation to play without the overhead of creating
		the pixmaps.
	BLOCK:  Set this keyword to have XMANAGER block when this
		application is registered.  By default the Xmanager
               keyword NO_BLOCK is set to 1 to provide access to the
               command line if active command 	line processing is available.
               Note that setting BLOCK for this application will cause
		all widget applications to block, not only this
		application.  For more information see the NO_BLOCK keyword
		to XMANAGER.
	ORDER:	Set this keyword to display images from the top down instead
		of the default bottom up.  This keyword is only used when
		loading images.
       MODAL:  If set, then XINTERANIMATE1 runs in "modal" mode, meaning that
               all other widgets are blocked until the user quits
               XINTERANIMATE1.
	png_name: base name for png input file list.
     SHOWLOAD:	Set this keyword (in conjunction with the SET keyword) to
		display each frame and update the frame slider as frames are
		loaded.

	SET:	This keyword initializes XINTERANIMATE1.  SET should be equated
		to a 3-element integer vector containing the following
		parameters:
		  Sizex, Sizey:	The width and height of the images to be
				displayed, in pixels.

		  Nframes:	The number of frames in the animated sequence
				(since XINTERANIMATE1 is an animation routine,
				Nframes must be at least 2 frames).

	TITLE:	A string to be used as the title of the widget.  If this
		keyword is not specified, the title is set to "XInterAnimate1"
		This keyword has an effect only when used in conjunction with
		the SET keyword).

	TRACK: If set, the frame slider tracks the current frame.  Default
		is not to track.  Provide this keyword with the SET keyword.

	WINDOW:	When this keyword is specified, an image is copied from an
		existing window to the animation pixmap.  When using X
		windows, this technique is much faster than reading
		from the display and then calling XINTERANIMATE1 with a 2D
		array.

		The value of this parameter is either an IDL window
		number (in which case the entire window is copied),
		or a vector containing the window index and the rectangular
		bounds of the area to be copied, for example:
		WINDOW = [Window_Number, X0, Y0, Sx, Sy]

      XOFFSET:	The horizontal offset, in pixels from the left of the frame,
		of the image in the destination window.

      YOFFSET:	The vertical offset, in pixels from the bottom of the frame,
		of the image in the destination window.

 OUTPUTS:
	No explicit outputs.

 COMMON BLOCKS:
	XINTERANIMATE1_COM: a private common block.

 SIDE EFFECTS:
	A pixmap and widget are created.

 RESTRICTIONS:
	Only a single copy of XINTERANIMATE1 can run at a time.

 PROCEDURE:
	When initialized, this procedure creates an approximately square
	pixmap or memory buffer, large enough to contain Nframes of
	the requested size.  Once the images are loaded, using the
	IMAGE and FRAME keywords, they are displayed by copying the images
	from the pixmap or buffer to the visible draw widget.

 EXAMPLE:
	Enter the following commands to open the file ABNORM.DAT (a series
	of images of a human heart) and animate the images it contains using
	XINTERANIMATE1.  For a more detailed example of using XINTERANIMATE1,
	see the example in the "Using IDL Widgets" chapter of "IDL Basics".
	Read the images into the variable H by entering:

		OPENR, 1, FILEPATH('abnorm.dat', SUBDIR = 'examples/data')
		H = BYTARR(64, 64, 16)
		READU, 1, H
		CLOSE, 1
		H = REBIN(H, 128, 128, 16)

	Initialize XINTERANIMATE1 with the command:

		XINTERANIMATE1, SET=[128, 128, 16], /SHOWLOAD

	Load the images into XINTERANIMATE1 and play the animation by entering:

		FOR I=0,15 DO XINTERANIMATE1, FRAME = I, IMAGE = H[*,*,I]
		XINTERANIMATE1

 MODIFICATION HISTORY:
	DMS, April, 1990.
	SMR, December, 1990.  	Modified the XANIMATE code to work
				interactively with widgets.

	DMS, March, 1991.	Modified the routine to use individual pixmaps
				for each frame of the animation.  Also added
				the ability to read in from current IDL
				windows directly into offscreen bitmap.

	SMR, March, 1991.	Modified to use new XMANAGER keyword CLEANUP
				to clean up the offscreen pixmaps when dying.

	SMR, Jan, 1992.		Modified the /CLOSE portion to check for a
				valid widget before using WIDGET_CONTROL
				and /DESTROY.

	AB, June 1992		Rewrite using the new CW_ANIMATE compound
				widget. Added the KEEP_PIXMAPS keyword.

	DJE, April, 1996	Replaced XANNOUNCE with DIALOG_MESSAGE

       SJL, December, 1997     Added MPEG capability.

	LP, 6/16/98             Added MODAL keyword.

       Spitale 5.2012		Removed MPEG BS, added PNG support
