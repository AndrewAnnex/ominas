PG_CUSPS


 PURPOSE:
	Computes image points at the limb/terminator cusps for each given 
	globe object.


 CATEGORY:
	NV/PG


 CALLING SEQUENCE:
	cusp_ps = pg_cusps(cd=cd, od=od, gbx=gbx)
	cusp_ps = pg_cusps(gd=gd)


 ARGUMENTS:
  INPUT: NONE

  OUTPUT: NONE


 KEYWORDS:
  INPUT:
	cd:	 Array (n_timesteps) of camera descriptors.

	od:	 Array (n_timesteps) of descriptors for the observer, 
		 default is the sun is gd given.

	gbx:	 Array (n_objects, n_timesteps) of descriptors of objects 
		 which must be a subclass of GLOBE.

	gd:	 Generic descriptor.  If given, the cd, od, and gbx inputs 
		 are taken from this structure instead of from those keywords.

	epsilon: Maximum angular error in the result.  Default is 1e-3.

	reveal:	 Normally, points computed for objects whose opaque flag
		 is set are made invisible.  /reveal suppresses this behavior.


  OUTPUT: NONE


 RETURN:
	Array (n_objects) of pg_points_struct containing image
	points and the corresponding inertial vectors.


 PROCEDURE:
	This program uses an iterative scheme to find the two points on 
	the surface of the globe where the surface normal is simultaneously
	perpendicular to the vectors from the camera and the Sun.
