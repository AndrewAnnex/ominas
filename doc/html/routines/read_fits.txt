READ_FITS


 PURPOSE:
	Reads a FITS file into IDL data and optionally header variables.


 CATEGORY:
	UTIL/FITS


 CALLING SEQUENCE:
	result = read_fits(filename, [ header ])


 ARGUMENTS:
  INPUT:
	filename:	String containing the name of the file to be read.

  OUTPUT:
	header:		String array containing the header from the FITS file.


 KEYWORDS:
  INPUT:
	NOSCALE:	If present and non-zero, then the ouput data will not be
			scaled using the optional BSCALE and BZERO keywords in
			the FITS header.   Default is to scale.

	SILENT:		Normally, READFITS will display the size the array at
			the terminal.  The SILENT keyword will suppress this

	NaNVALUE:	This scalar is only needed on Vax architectures.   It 
			specifying the value to translate any IEEE "not a
			number" values in the FITS data array.   It is needed
			because the Vax does not recognize the "not a number"
			convention.

	EXTEN_NO:	Scalar integer specify the FITS extension to read.  For
			example, specify EXTEN = 1 or /EXTEN to read the first 
			FITS extension.    Extensions are read using recursive
			calls to READFITS.

	POINT_LUN:	Position (in bytes) in the FITS file at which to start
			reading.   Useful if READFITS is called by another
			procedure which needs to directly read a FITS extension.
			Should always be a multiple of 2880.

	STARTROW:	This keyword only applies when reading a FITS extension
			It specifies the row (scalar integer) of the extension
			table at which to begin reading. Useful when one does
			not want to read the entire table.

	NUMROW:		This keyword only applies when reading a FITS extension. 
			If specifies the number of rows (scalar integer) of the 
			extension table to read.   Useful when one does not want
			to read the entire table.

  OUTPUT: NONE


 RETURN:
	FITS data array constructed from designated record.


 RESTRICTIONS:
     (1)	Cannot handle random group FITS
     (2)       User's with versions of IDL before 2.2.1 should remove the
               call to the TEMPORARY function near the end of the program


 EXAMPLE:
	Read a FITS file TEST.FITS into an IDL image array, IM and FITS 
       header array, H.   Do not scale the data with BSCALE and BZERO.

              IDL> im = READFITS( 'TEST.FITS', h, /NOSCALE)

       If the file contain a FITS extension, it could be read with

              IDL> tab = READFITS( 'TEST.FITS', htab, /EXTEN )

       To read only rows 100-149 of the FITS extension,

              IDL> tab = READFITS( 'TEST.FITS', htab, /EXTEN, 
                                    STARTR=100, NUMR = 50 )


 STATUS:
	Complete

 MODIFICATION HISTORY:
       MODIFIED, Wayne Landsman  October, 1991
                Reset BSCALE and BZERO after using them
       Added call to TEMPORARY function to speed processing     Feb-92
       Added a check for fixed record length file  under VMS    Jun-92
       Added STARTROW and NUMROW keywords for FITS tables       Jul-92
	Spitale; Jan 1998 - added xdr conversions, changed name
	                    from 'readfits' to 'read_fits'
