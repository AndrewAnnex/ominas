 CALLING SEQUENCE:
     outline_ps=pg_ring_sector_box_oblique()
     outline_ps=pg_ring_sector_box_oblique(corners)


 ARGUMENTS:
  INPUT:
      corners:	    Array of image points giving the four corners of the box.
		    If not given, the user is prompted to select a box. 


  OUTPUT:
	NONE



 KEYWORDS:
  INPUT: 
      win_num:     Window number of IDL graphics window in which to select
                   box, default is current window.

      restore:     Do not leave the box in the image.

           p0:     First corner of box.  If set, then the routine immediately 
                   begins to drag from that point until a button is released.

        color:     Color to use for rectangle, default is !color.

        slope:     This keyword allows the longitude to vary from the
                   perpendicular direction as a function of radius as: 
                   lon = slope*(rad - rad0).

 xor_graphics:     If set, the sector outline is drawn and erased using xor
                   graphics instead of a pixmap.

    noverbose:     If set, messages are suppressed.

       sample:     Grid sampling, default is 1.


  OUTPUT:
         NONE


 RETURN: 
      pg_points_struct containing points on the sector outline.  The point
      spacing is determined by the sample keyword.  The points structure
      also contains the disk coordinate for each point and the user fields
      'nrad' and 'nlon' giving the number of points in radius and longitude.
