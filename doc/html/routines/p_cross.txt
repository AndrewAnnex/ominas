P_CROSS


 PURPOSE:
       Computes the cross products between the given arrays image vectors.

 CATEGORY:
       UTIL/V


 CALLING SEQUENCE:
       result = p_cross(p1, p2)


 ARGUMENTS:
  INPUT:
	p1:	An array of np x nt image vectors (i.e., 2 x np x nt).

	p2:	Another array of np x nt image vectors.


  OUTPUT:
       NONE

 RETURN:
       Array of np x nt out-of-image components of the cross products.  
	The in-plane components will always be zero.


 STATUS:
       Completed.
