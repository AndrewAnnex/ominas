PG_GRID_DISK


 PURPOSE:
	Computes image points on a radius/longitude grid for objects that 
	are a subclass of DISK.


	***This routine is obsolete.  Use pg_grid instead.

 CATEGORY:
	NV/PG


 CALLING SEQUENCE:
	grid_ps = pg_grid_disk(cd=cd, dkx=dkx, gbx=gbx)
	grid_ps = pg_grid_disk(gd=gd)


 ARGUMENTS:
  INPUT: NONE

  OUTPUT: NONE


 KEYWORDS:
  INPUT:
	cd:	Array (n_timesteps) of camera descriptors.

	dkx:	Array (n_objects, n_timesteps) of descriptors of objects 
		which must be a subclass of DISK.

	gbx:	Array  of descriptors of objects which must be a subclass 
		of GLOBE, describing the primary body.  For each
		timestep, only the first descriptor is used.

	gd:	Generic descriptor.  If given, the cd and dkx inputs 
		are taken from the cd and dkx fields of this structure
		instead of from those keywords.

	reveal:	Normally, points computed for objects whose opaque flag
		is set are made invisible.  /reveal suppresses this behavior.

	fov:	If set points are computed only within this many camera
		fields of view.

	cull:	If set, points structures excluded by the fov keyword
		are not returned.  Normally, empty points structures
		are returned as placeholders.

	nrad:	Number of radial grid lines.  Default is 4.

	nlon:	Number of longitudinal grid lines. Default is 36.

	nrpoints:	Number of points per radial grid line. Defauly is 500.

	nlpoints:	Number of points per longitudinal grid line. Defauly 
			is 720.

	rad:	If given, radii at which to put grid lines.

	lon:	If given, longitudes at which to put grid lines.
	

  OUTPUT: NONE


 RETURN:
	Array (n_objects) of pg_points_struct containing image points and
	the corresponding inertial vectors.
