STRCAT_TYCHO_INPUT


 PURPOSE:
        Input translator for Tycho-2 star catalog.


 CATEGORY:
       NV/PG


 CALLING SEQUENCE(only to be called by nv_get_value):
       result = strcat_tycho_input(dd, keyword)


 ARGUMENTS:
  INPUT:
	dd:		Data descriptor.

	keyword:	String giving the name of the translator quantity.

  OUTPUT:
       NONE

 KEYWORDS:
  INPUT:
	key1:		Observer descriptor, must be of subclass CAMERA.

  OUTPUT:
	status:		Zero if valid data is returned.

	n_obj:		Number of objects returned.

	dim:		Dimensions of return objects.


  TRANSLATOR KEYWORDS:
 	jtime:		Years since 1950 (the epoch of catalog) for precession
			and proper motion correction.  If not given, it is taken
			from the object descriptor bod_time, which is assumed to
			be seconds past 1950 unless keyword /j2000 is set.

	j2000:		If set, coordinates are output wrt j2000.

	b1950:		If set, coordinates are output wrt b1950.

	path_tycho:	The directory of the star catalog.   If not given, the
 			routine uses the environment variable 'NV_TYCHO_DATA'.  
			The catalog data is grouped into approx 10,000 separate
			regions in numbered files in 24 separate subdirectories.
			Each star has a data record of 16 bytes.
			Two identifying numbers: TYCHO_ID_1 and TYCHO_ID_2, 
			RA_DEG and DEC_DEG (degrees), RApm and DECpm 
			(milliarcseconds/year), and MAG (Visual Magnitude). 
			The real values (RA_DEG, DEC_DEG, RApm, DECpm, and MAG) 
			are in XDR, the GSC_ID and CLASS are network-order 
			short integers.

	faint:		Stars with magnitudes fainter than this will not be
			returned.

	bright:		Stars with magnitudes brighter than this will not be
			returned.


  ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES:
	NV_TYCHO_DATA:	Directory containing the TYCHO catalog data unless
			overridden using the path_tycho translator keyword.


 RETURN:
       Star descriptor containing all the stars found.  The Sp part of
       the star descriptor contains neither the Spectral type nor the 
       GSC class. 

 RESTRICTIONS:
       Since the distance to stars are not given in the GSC catalog, the
       position vector magnitude is set as 10 parsec and the luminosity
       is calculated from the visual magnitude and the 10 parsec distance.


 PROCEDURE:
       Stars are found in a square area in RA and DEC around a given
       or calculated center.  The star descriptor is filled with stars
       that fit in this area.  If B1950 is selected, input RA, DEC and/or
	ods orient matrix is assumed to be B1950 also, if not, input is
	assumed to be J2000, like the catalog.
