MBFIT


 PURPOSE:
	Performs a simultaneous least square fit using the given coefficients.


 CATEGORY:
	UTIL


 CALLING SEQUENCE:
	result = mbfit(M, b)


 ARGUMENTS:
  INPUT:
	M:	Array (3,3,n) of coefficient matrices as computed by 
		icv_coeff or ipt_coeff.  Coefficients from the two sources
		may be mixed.

	b:	Array (n,3) of coefficient vectors as computed by 
		icv_coeff or ipt_coeff.  Coefficients from the two sources
		may be mixed.

  OUTPUT: NONE


 KEYWORDS:
  INPUT: NONE

  OUTPUT: NONE


 RETURN:
	3-element vector giving the offset as [dx,dy,dtheta].


 PROCEDURE:
	The simultaneous fit is performed by solving the system of equations

				SM x = Sb,

	where SM and Sb represent the sums of the M and b arguments over the 
	'n' dimension respectively, and x is the return vector, [dx,dy,dtheta].
