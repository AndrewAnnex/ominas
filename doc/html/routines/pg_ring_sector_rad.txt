PG_RING_SECTOR_RAD

 PURPOSE:
	Allows the user to select a ring sector by clicking and dragging.
	The sector is defined along lines of constant radius and longitude.
 
 CATEGORY:
       NV/PG

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
     outline_ps=pg_ring_sector_rad(cd=cd, dkx=dkx, gbx=gbx)


 ARGUMENTS:
  INPUT:
      NONE

  OUTPUT:
	NONE



 KEYWORDS:
  INPUT: 
           cd:     Camera descriptor.

	   dkx:     Disk descriptor describing the ring.

          gbx:     Globe descriptor giving the primary for the ring.

           gd:     Generic descriptor containing the above descriptors.

      win_num:     Window number of IDL graphics window in which to select
                   box, default is current window.

      restore:     Do not leave the box in the image.

           p0:     First corner of box.  If set, then the routine immediately 
                   begins to drag from that point until a button is released.

        color:     Color to use for rectangle, default is !color.

       sample:     Sets the grid sampling in pixels.  Default is one.

        slope:     This keyword allows the longitude to vary as a function 
                   of radius as: lon = slope*(rad - rad0).

 xor_graphics:     If set, the sector outline is drawn and erased using xor
                   graphics instead of a pixmap.

    noverbose:     If set, messages are suppressed.

        nodsk:     If set, image points will not be included in the output 
                   pg_points_struct.


  OUTPUT:
         NONE


 RETURN: 
      pg_points_struct containing points on the sector outline.  The point
      spacing is determined by the sample keyword.  The points structure
      also contains the disk coordinate for each point and the user fields
      'nrad' and 'nlon' giving the number of points in radius and longitude.
