CHECK_FITS


 PURPOSE:
	Given a FITS array IM, and a associated FITS or STSDAS header HDR, this
	procedure will check that
		(1) HDR is a string array, and IM is defined and numeric   
		(2) The NAXISi values in HDR are appropiate to the dimensions 
                   of IM
		(3) The BITPIX value in HDR is appropiate to the datatype of IM


 CATEGORY:
	UTIL/FITS


 CALLING SEQUENCE:
	check_fits, im, hdr, [ dimen, idltype, /UPDATE, /NOTYPE, /SDAS ]


 ARGUMENTS:
  INPUT:
	im:	FITS or  STSDAS array, (e.g. as read by SXREAD or READFITS ).

	hdr:	FITS or  STSDAS header (string array) associated with im.

  OUTPUT:
	dimen:		Vector containing actual array dimensions

	idltype:	Data type of the FITS array as specified in the IDL SIZE
			function (1 for BYTE, 2 for INTEGER*2, 3 for INTEGER*4,
			etc.)


 KEYWORDS:
  INPUT:
	NOTYPE:	If this keyword is set, then only agreement of the array
		dimensions with the FITS header are checked, and not the 
		data type.

	UPDATE:	If this keyword is set then the BITPIX, NAXIS and DATATYPE
		FITS keywords will be updated to agree with the array.

	SDAS:	If this keyword is set then the header is assumed to be from
		an SDAS (.hhh) file.    CHECK_FITS will then ensure that (1)
		a DATATYPE keyword is included in the header and (2) BITPIX
		is always written with positive values.

	FITS:	If this keyword is present then CHECK_FITS assumes that it is
		dealing with a FITS header and not an SDAS header, see notes
		below.

  OUTPUT: NONE


 RETURN: NONE


 SIDE EFFECTS:
	If there is a fatal problem with the FITS array or header then !ERR is
	set to -1.   ( If the UPDATE keyword was supplied, and the header could
	be fixed then !ERR = 0.)


 NOTES:
	An important distinction between an STSDAS header and a FITS header
	is that the BITPIX value in an STSDAS is always positive, e.g. BITPIX=32
	for REAL*4 data.    Users should use either the /SDAS or the /FITS 
	keyword if it is important whether the STSDAS or FITS convention for 
	REAL*4 data is used.  Otherwise, CHECK_FITS assumes that if a 
	DATATYPE keyword is present then it is dealing with an STSDAS header.


 PROCEDURE:
	Program checks the NAXIS1 and NAXIS2 parameters in the header to
	see if they match the image array dimensions.


 STATUS:
	Complete
