PG_NORTHANGLE


 PURPOSE:
	Computes the angle between the image-coordinate y-axis and the 
	projected z-axis of the given body.  Increasing angle corresponds to 
	clockwise rotation in the image. 


 CATEGORY:
	NV/PG


 CALLING SEQUENCE:
	northangle = pg_northangle(cd=cd, bx=bx)
	northangle = pg_northangle(gd=gd)


 ARGUMENTS:
  INPUT: NONE

  OUTPUT: NONE


 KEYWORDS:
  INPUT:
	cd:	Array (n_timesteps) of camera descriptors.

	bx:	Array (n_objects, n_timesteps) of descriptors of objects 
		which must be a subclass of BODY.

	gd:	Generic descriptor.  If given, the cd and bx inputs 
		are taken from the cd and bx fields of this structure
		instead of from those keywords.

  OUTPUT: NONE


 RETURN:
	Array (n_objects) of double giving the northangles in radians.


 STATUS:
