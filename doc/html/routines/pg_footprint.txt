PG_FOOTPRINT


 PURPOSE:
	Computes the footprint of a camera on a given body.


 CATEGORY:
	NV/PG


 CALLING SEQUENCE:
       footprint_ps = footprint(cd=cd, bx=bx)


 ARGUMENTS:
  INPUT: NONE

  OUTPUT: NONE


 KEYWORDS:
  INPUT:
	cd:	Array (n_timesteps) of camera descriptors.

	bx:	Array (n_objects, n_timesteps) of descriptors of objects 
		which must be a subclass of BODY.

	gd:	Generic descriptor.  If given, the cd and bx inputs 
		are taken from the cd and bx fields of this structure
		instead of from those keywords.

	frame_bd:	Subclass of BODY giving the frame against which to 
			measure inclinations and nodes, e.g., a planet 
			descriptor.  One per bx.

	fov:	 If set points are computed only within this many camera
		 fields of view.

	sample:	 Sampling rate; default is 1 pixel.

  OUTPUT: NONE


 RETURN:
	Array (n_objects) of pg_points_struct containing image points and
	the corresponding inertial vectors.


 STATUS:
	Complete
