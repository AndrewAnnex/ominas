CURSOR_MOVE


 PURPOSE:
       Moves an array of points by using the cursor and then to output
       the change from the original position when finished.  In moving
       the cursor, the mouse buttons control the motion:  LEFT to translate,
       MIDDLE to rotate, RIGHT to accept.


 CATEGORY:
       UTIL


 CALLING SEQUENCE:
       cursor_move, cx, cy, xpoints, ypoints, sub_xpoints, sub_ypoints, $
                        dx=dx, dy=dy, dtheta=dtheta


 ARGUMENTS:
  INPUT:
            cx:        x position of center of rotation.

            cy:        y position of center of rotation.

       xpoints:        x positions of array of points to display

       ypoints:         y positions of  rray of points to display

   sub_xpoints:        Sub-sampled x points to display.

   sub_ypoints:        Sub-sampled y points to display.

  KEYWORDS:

      symbol:          symbol to use for marking points, default is period

      star_sub:	If given, these subscripts (into the sub-sampled arrays)
			determine points that should be plotted using
			star_symbol.

  OUTPUT:
            dx:        Change in x in pixels.

            dy:        Change in y in pixels.

        dtheta:        Change in rotation angle in radians.

 STATUS:
       Completed.
