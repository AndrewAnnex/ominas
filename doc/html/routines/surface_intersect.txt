SURFACE_INTERSECT


 PURPOSE:
	Computes the intersection of rays with surface objects.


 CATEGORY:
       NV/LIB/TOOLS/COMPOSITE


 CALLING SEQUENCE:
	int_pts = surface_intersect(bx, v, r)


 ARGUMENTS:
  INPUT: 
	bx:	Array (nt) of any subclass of BODY descriptors with
		the expected surface parameters.

	v:	Array (nv,3,nt) giving ray origins in the BODY frame.

	r:	Array (nv,3,nt) giving ray directions in the BODY frame.


  OUTPUT: NONE


 KEYWORDS:
  INPUT: 
	frame_bd:  Frame descriptor, if required for bx.

  OUTPUT: NONE


 RETURN: 
	Array (2*nv,3,nt) of points in the BODY frame, where 
	int_pts[0:nv-1,*,*] correspond to the near-side intersections
	and int_pts[nv:2*nv-1,*,1] correspond to the far side.  Zero 
	vector is returned for points with no solution.
