B1950_TO_J2000


 PURPOSE:
	Transforms vectors from B1950 to J2000 coordinates, or visa-versa.


 CATEGORY:
	UTIL


 CALLING SEQUENCE:
	result = b1950_to_j2000(v)


 ARGUMENTS:
  INPUT:

	      v:	An array of (n,3) column vectors in B1950
			(or J2000 if /reverse is used)


  OUTPUT: NONE


 KEYWORDS:
  INPUT: 

	reverse:	If set, then J2000 to B1950 is done.

  OUTPUT: NONE


 PROCEDURE:
	Multiplies the input vector by a transformation matrix.  The
  transformation matrix from B1950 to J2000 was defined using the
  December 20, 1984 memo from Mert Davies (Rand) to Larry Soderblom (USGS)


 RETURN:
	An array of vectors in the other coordinate system.


 RESTRICTIONS:
	Output array is double precision.


 STATUS:
	Complete.
