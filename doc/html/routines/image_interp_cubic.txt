IMAGE_INTERP_CUBIC


 PURPOSE:
       Extracts a region from an image using cubic interpolation.


 CATEGORY:
       UTIL


 CALLING SEQUENCE:
       result = image_interp_cubic(image, grid_x, grid_y)


 ARGUMENTS:
  INPUT:
        image:         An array of image point arrays.

       grid_x:         The grid of x positions for interpolation

       grid_y:         The grid of y positions for interpolation

	     k:		"Half-width" of the convolution window.  The
			window actually covers the central pixel, plus
			k pixels in each direction.  Default is 3, which
			gives a 7x7 window.

	fwhm:		If set, a gaussian with this half width is used for 
			the psf instead of caling the user-supplied function.

  OUTPUT:
       NONE


 KEYORDS:
  INPUT:
	psf_fn:		Name of a function to compute the psf:

				psf_fn(psf_data, x,y)

			where x and y are the location relative to the 
			center, and must accept arrays of any dimension.

	psf_data:	Data for psf function as shown above.

	mask:		Byte image indcating which pixels (value GT 0) should
			be excluded from the interpolation.

  OUTPUT:
       NONE


 RETURN:
       Array of interpolated points at the (grid_x, grid_y) points.


 STATUS:
       Completed.
