PG_RM_DISK


 PURPOSE:
	Hides the given points with respect to each given disk and observer
	at all given time steps.  Points are hidden whether they lie in
	front of or behind the disk.


 CATEGORY:
	NV/PG


 CALLING SEQUENCE:
	pg_rm_disk, object_ps, cd=cd, od=od, dkx=dkx, gbx=gbx
	pg_rm_disk, object_ps, gd=gd, od=od


 ARGUMENTS:
  INPUT:
	object_ps:	Array of pg_points_struct containing inertial vectors.

	hide_ps:	Array (n_disks, n_timesteps) of pg_points_struct 
			containing the hidden points.

  OUTPUT: NONE


 KEYWORDS:
  INPUT:
	cd:	Array (n_timesteps) of camera descriptors.

	dkx:	Array (n_timesteps) of descriptors of objects 
		which must be a subclass of DISK.

	gbx:	Array  of descriptors of objects which must be a subclass 
		of GLOBE, describing the primary body for dkx.  For each
		timestep, only the first descriptor is used.

	od:	Array (n_objects, n_timesteps) of descriptors of objects 
		which must be a subclass of BODY.  These objects are used
		as the observer from which points are hidden.  If no observer
		descriptor is given, the camera descriptor is used.

	gd:	Generic descriptor.  If given, the cd and dkx inputs 
		are taken from the cd and dkx fields of this structure
		instead of from those keywords.

	reveal:	 Normally, objects whose opaque flag is set are ignored.  
		 /reveal suppresses this behavior.

	cat:	If set, the hide_ps points are concatentated into a single
		pg_points_struct.

  OUTPUT: NONE


 RETURN: NONE


 SIDE EFFECTS:
	The flags arrays in object_ps are modified.


 PROCEDURE:
	For each object in object_ps, hidden points are computed and
	PGS_INVISIBLE_FLAG in the pg_points_struct is set.  No points are
	removed from the array.


 EXAMPLE:
	The following command hides all points which are directly in front of 
	or behind the rings as seen by the camera:

	pg_rm_disk, object_ps, cd=cd, dkx=rd

	In this call, rd is a ring descriptor, and cd is a camera descriptor.


 STATUS:
	Complete
