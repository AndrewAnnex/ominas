PHASE_CORRECTION


 PURPOSE:
	Assuming body gbx is a sphere, this routine computes the correction
	in pixels needed to obtain its true image center given a measurement 
	of its center of light.


 CATEGORY:
       NV/LIB/TOOLS


 CALLING SEQUENCE:
       dxy = phase_correction(cd, gbx, sund)


 ARGUMENTS:

	cd:	Any subclass of DISK.

	gbx:	Any subclass of GLOBE.

	sund:	STAR descriptor representing the sun.

  OUTPUT:  NONE


 KEYOWRDS:
  INPUT: NONE

  OUTPUT: NONE


 RETURN: 
	Array (2) giving the phase correction offset.
