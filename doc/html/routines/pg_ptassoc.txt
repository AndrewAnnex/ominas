PG_PTASSOC


 PURPOSE:
	Associates points between two arrays by searching for the most
	frequent offset between the two.


 CATEGORY:
	NV/PG


 CALLING SEQUENCE:
	assoc_scan_ps = pg_ptassoc(scan_ps, model_ps, assoc_model_ps)


 ARGUMENTS:
  INPUT:
	scan_ps:	pg_points_struct(s) containing first array, typically
			an array of candidate points detected in an image.

	model_ps:	pg_points_struct(s) containing the second array, typically
			an array of computed model points.

  OUTPUT: 
	assoc_model_ps:	pg_points_struct containing the output model points.  
			Each of these points is associated with a point
			in the returned array.  If this argument is not
			present, the model_ps array is overwritten with
			the output model points.


 KEYWORDS:
  INPUT: NONE

  OUTPUT: NONE


 RETURN:
	pg_points_struct containing an associated scan point for each output
	model point in assoc_model_ps.  


 PROCEDURE:
	Points are associated by searching for the most frequent offset
	between scan points and model points.


 STATUS:
	Complete
