PG_HIDE_LIMB


 PURPOSE:
	Hides the given points with respect to the limb of each given globe and
	observer.  This routine is only relevant for points that lie on the 
	surface of a body.  pg_hide_globe should be used for non-surface
	points.


 CATEGORY:
	NV/PG


 CALLING SEQUENCE:
	pg_hide_limb, object_ps, cd=cd, od=od, gbx=gbx
	pg_hide_limb, object_ps, gd=gd, od=od


 ARGUMENTS:
  INPUT:
	object_ps:	Array of pg_points_struct containing inertial vectors.

	hide_ps:	Array (n_disks, n_timesteps) of pg_points_struct 
			containing the hidden points.

  OUTPUT: NONE


 KEYWORDS:
  INPUT:
	cd:	Array (n_timesteps) of camera descriptors.

	gbx:	Array (n_globes, n_timesteps) of descriptors of objects 
		which must be a subclass of GLOBE.  n_globes must be the
		same as the number of object_ps arrays.

	od:	Array (n_timesteps) of descriptors of objects 
		which must be a subclass of BODY.  These objects are used
		as the observer from which points are hidden.  If no observer
		descriptor is given, the camera descriptor is used.

	gd:	Generic descriptor.  If given, the cd and gbx inputs 
		are taken from the cd and gbx fields of this structure
		instead of from those keywords.

	reveal:	 Normally, objects whose opaque flag is set are ignored.  
		 /reveal suppresses this behavior.

  OUTPUT: NONE


 RETURN: NONE


 SIDE EFFECTS:
	The flags arrays in object_ps are modified.


 RESTRICTIONS:
	The result is meaningless if the given inertial vectors do not lie
	on the surface of the globe.


 PROCEDURE:
	For each object in object_ps, hidden points are computed and
	PGS_INVISIBLE_FLAG in the pg_points_struct is set.  No points are
	removed from the array.


 EXAMPLE:
	The following command hides all points which lie on the surface of the
	planet behind the limb as seen by the camera:

	pg_hide_limb, object_ps, cd=cd, gbx=pd

	In this call, pd is a planet descriptor, and cd is a camera descriptor.


 STATUS:
	Complete
