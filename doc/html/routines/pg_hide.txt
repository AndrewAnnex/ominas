PG_HIDE


 PURPOSE:
	Hides the given points with respect to each given object and observer
	using pg_hide/rm_disk, pg_hide/rm_globe, or pg_hide_limb.


 CATEGORY:
	NV/PG


 CALLING SEQUENCE:
	pg_hide, object_ps, cd=cd, od=od, gbx=gbx, dkx=dkx, /[disk|globe|limb]
	pg_hide, object_ps, gd=gd, od=od, /[disk|globe|limb]


 ARGUMENTS:
  INPUT: 
	object_ps:	Array of pg_points_struct containing inertial vectors.

	hide_ps:	Array (n_disks, n_timesteps) of pg_points_struct 
			containing the hidden points.

  OUTPUT: NONE


 KEYWORDS:
  INPUT:
	globe:	If set, use pg_hide_globe or pg_rm_globe.

	disk:	If set, use pg_hide_disk or pg_rm_disk.

	limb:	If set, use pg_hide_limb .

	rm:	If set use the *rm* programs instead of *hide* programs.

	  All other keywords are passed directly to pg_rm/hide_globe,
	  pg_hide/rm_disk or pg_hide_limb and are documented with those
	  programs.

  OUTPUT: NONE


 RETURN: NONE


 SIDE EFFECTS:
	The flags arrays in object_ps are modified.


 PROCEDURE:
	For each object in object_ps, hidden points are computed and
	PGS_INVISIBLE_FLAG in the pg_points_struct is set.  No points are
	removed from the array.


 EXAMPLE:
	(1) The following command hides all points on the planet which lie
	    behind the terminator:

	    pg_hide, object_ps, /limb, gbx=pd, od=sd

	    In this call, pd is a planet descriptor, and sd is a star descriptor
	    (i.e., the sun).



	(2) This command hides all points on the planet which are shadowed by
	    the rings:

	    pg_hide, object_ps, /disk, dkx=rd, od=sd

	    In this call, rd is a ring descriptor, and sd is as above.



	(3) This command hides all points which lie behind the planet or the
	    rings:

	    pg_hide, object_ps, /disk, /globe, dkx=rd, gbx=pd, cd=cd

	    In this call, rd is a ring descriptor, pd is a planet descriptor, 
	    cd is a camera descriptor, and sd is as above.


 STATUS:
	Complete
