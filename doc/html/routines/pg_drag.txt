PG_DRAG


 PURPOSE:
	Allows the user to graphically translate and rotate an array of points
	using the mouse.


 CATEGORY:
	NV/PG


 CALLING SEQUENCE:
	dxy = pg_drag(object_ps, dtheta=dtheta, axis_ps=axis_ps)


 ARGUMENTS:
  INPUT:
	object_ps:	Array (n_objects) of pg_points_struct containing the
			image points to be dragged.

  OUTPUT: 
	object_ps:	If /move, the input points will be modified by the
			offsets resulting from the drag.


 KEYWORDS:
  INPUT:
	axis_ps:	pg_points_struct containing a single image point
			to be used as the axis of rotation.

	sample:		Sampling interval for drag graphics.  The input
			points are subsampled at this interval so that the
			dragging can be done smoothly.  Default is 10.

	move:		If set, object_ps will be modified on return using
			pg_move.

	symbol:		If set, the symbol number will be passed to cursor_move
			so something other than a period can be used to mark
			points.

	noverbose:	If set, turns off the notification that cursor
                       movement is required.

	xor_graphics:	If set, grahics are drawn using the XOR function.

	color:		Drawing color.  Default is ctyellow.

  OUTPUT:
	dtheta:		Dragged rotation in radians.


 RETURN:
	2-element array giving the drag translation as [dx,dy].


 PROCEDURE:
	cursor_move is used to perfform the drag.  See that routine for more
	detail.


 STATUS:
	Complete
