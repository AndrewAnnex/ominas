PG_MASK


 PURPOSE:
	Uses the given geometry to compute an image mask for all objects
	in a scene.


 CATEGORY:
	NV/PG


 CALLING SEQUENCE:
	mask = pg_mask(cd=cd, gbx=gbx, dkx=dkx, bx=bx, sund=sund)
	mask = pg_mask(gd=gd)


 ARGUMENTS:
  INPUT: NONE

  OUTPUT: NONE


 KEYWORDS:
  INPUT:
	cd:	Camera descriptor.

	gbx:	Globe descriptors.

	dkx:	Disk descriptors.

	bx:	Body descriptors (i.e. point sources).

	sund:	Star descriptor giving the sun.

	gd:	Generic descriptor containing the above descriptors.

	fgbx,fdkx,fbx:	Fractonal amount to increase the radii of each
			descriptor type.

	dgbx,ddkx,dbx:	Absolute amount, in physical units (e.g. meters), to 
			increase the radii of each descriptor type.

	pgbx,pdkx,pbx:	Absolute amount, in mask pixels, to increase the radii 
			of each descriptor type.

	nodd;    If set, no data descriptor is created.

	np:      Number of points to use in computing curves.  Default is 1000.

  OUTPUT:
	limb_ps:	pg_points_struct giving the computed limb points.

	term_ps:	pg_points_struct giving the computed terminator points.

	disk_ps:	pg_points_struct giving the computed disk points.

	body_ps:	pg_points_struct giving the computed body points.


 RETURN:
	Data descriptor containing a byte image in which pixels corresponding 
	to objects are set to 1.


 STATUS:
	Complete.
