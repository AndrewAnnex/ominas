V_ROTATE_11


 PURPOSE:
       Rotates the (nv,3,nt) column vectors, v, about the (nv,3,nt) column
       vectors, n, by the (nv,nt) angles theta.  The sin and cos of theta are
       given in order to improve performance.  Each vector in v is rotated
       about the corresponding vector in n by the corresponding angle in theta.


 CATEGORY:
       UTIL/V


 CALLING SEQUENCE:
       result = v_rotate_11(v, n, sin_theta, cos_theta)


 ARGUMENTS:
  INPUT:
               v:      An array of N column vectors

               n:      An array of N column vectors

       sin_theta:      Sine of rotation angle theta

       cos_theta:      Cosine of rotation angle theta


  OUTPUT:
       NONE

 RETURN:
       If the arguments have dimensions v(nv,3,nt), n(nv,3,nt) and
       sin_theta(nv,nt), cos_theta(nv,nt) then the result has dimensions
       (nv,3,nt).


 RESTRICTIONS:
       v and n must have exactly the same dimensions.
       sin_theta and cos_theta must be 1-dimensional arrays of any length
       as long as the lengths are the same.  Note that if only one theta
       is specified, the arguments must be given as [sin_theta], [cos_theta]
       instead of as scalars.

 STATUS:
       Completed.
