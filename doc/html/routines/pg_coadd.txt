PG_COADD


 PURPOSE:
	Averages the given images and geometries. 


 CATEGORY:
	NV/PG


 CALLING SEQUENCE:
	dd0 = pg_coadd(dd, bx0, cd=cd, bx=bx)


 ARGUMENTS:
  INPUT:
	dd:	Array of data descriptors giving images to average.

  OUTPUT: 
	bx0:	Averaged bx body descriptors.


 KEYWORDS:
  INPUT:
	bx:	Array [ndd] or [ndd,n] of descriptors of any superclass of BODY,
		one for each input image, to be averaged.  Times, positions, and
		orientations are average.  In addition, for any camera
		descriptors, the optical axes are also averaged.

	gd:	Generic descriptor containing the body descriptors or an 
		array [ndd] of generic descriptors.

	median: If set, the median is used instead of the average.

	minimum: If set, the minimum is used instead of the average.

	maximum: If set, the maximum is used instead of the average.

	algorithm: String giving the alogrithm to use instead of specifying
		   One of the above keyowrds.  Default is 'average".

  OUTPUT: NONE
