V_SAMPLE


 PURPOSE:
       Resamples the given column vectors such that their spacing is 
	uniform.


 CATEGORY:
       UTIL/V


 CALLING SEQUENCE:
       result = v_sample(v, spacing=spacing)


 ARGUMENTS:
  INPUT:
               v:      An array of nv column vectors  (i.e., nv x 3 array) 
			to resample.  Note that the reason there is no
			nt direction is that unifrom spacing would impose
			differing numbers of elements in that direction, which
			is not permissible.

  OUTPUT:
       NONE

 RETURN:
       Array of nv uniformly-spaced column vectors.



 STATUS:
       Completed.
