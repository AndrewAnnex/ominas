CC_THRESHOLD


 PURPOSE:
       To threshold points by correlation coefficient.


 CATEGORY:
       UTIL


 CALLING SEQUENCE:
       result = cc_threshold(cc, min=min, max=max)


 ARGUMENTS:
  INPUT:
        cc:    An array of image point arrays.

  OUTPUT:
       NONE


 KEYWORDS:
  INPUT:
       min:    Minimum cc for threshold

       max:    Maximum cc for threshold

  relative:    If set, uses the maximum of the smoothed cc array,
               and min and max are relative to this maximum.

  OUTPUT:
       NONE

 RETURN:
       Subscripts into the cc array that are between the input minimum
       and maximum.
