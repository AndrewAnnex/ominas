RINGPLANE_RADIAL_BOUNDS


 PURPOSE:
	Finds ringplane radial bounds by projecting the camera FOV on 
	the ringplane.  


 CATEGORY:
       NV/LIB/TOOLS


 CALLING SEQUENCE:
       result = ringplane_radial_bounds(cd, dkx, frame_bd=frame_bdp)


 ARGUMENTS:
  INPUT:
	cd:	Camera descriptor.

	dkx:	Any subclass of DISK.

  OUTPUT:  NONE


 KEYOWRDS:
  INPUT: 
	frame_bd:	Subclass of BODY giving the frame against which to 
			measure inclinations and nodes, e.g., a planet 
			descriptor.

  OUTPUT: NONE


 RETURN:
       Array (2) giving the minimum and maximum disk radii visible 
	to the camera.
