 PURPOSE:
       Calculates the correlation coefficient between an image and
       a model.


 CATEGORY:
       UTIL


 CALLING SEQUENCE:
       result = c_correlate_2d(image, model)


 ARGUMENTS:
  INPUT:
       image:  Two dimensional image.

       model:  The model to correlelate with the image (sm[1] x sm[2])

  OUTPUT:
	NONE

 KEYWORDS:
  INPUT:
	NONE

  OUTPUT:
       sigma:  The sigma of the image in a box of size sm[1] x sm[2]
               around each point

        mean:  The mean of the image in a box of size sm[1] x sm[2]
               around each point


 RETURN:
