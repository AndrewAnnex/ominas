GRIM_MENU_VIEW_ZOOM_HALF_EVENT


 PURPOSE:
	Selects the zoom cursor mode.


 CATEGORY:
	NV/GR


 OPERATION:
	The image zoom and offset are controlled by selecting
	a box in the image.  When the box is created using the
	left mouse button, zoom and offset are changed so that 
	the contents of the box best fill the current graphics
	window.  When the right button is used, the contents of
	the current graphics window are shrunken so as to best
	fill the box.  In other words, the left button zooms in
	and the right button zooms out.
