PG_THRESHOLD


 PURPOSE:
	Excludes points whose associated data lie outside of specified
	thresholds by setting the PGS_INVISIBLE_MASK.


 CATEGORY:
	NV/PG


 CALLING SEQUENCE:
	pg_threshold, object_ps, tag=tag, max=max, min=min


 ARGUMENTS:
  INPUT:
	object_ps:	Array (n_objects) of pg_points_struct giving the
			points to be thresholded.

  OUTPUT:
	object_ps:	Modified array of pg_points_struct.  PGS_INVISIBLE_MASK
			is set for all excluded points.


 KEYWORDS:
  INPUT:
	tag:		Tag name for user data array to threshold.  Default
			is 'scan_cc'.

	max:		Upper threshold - values greater than this will be
			excluded.

	min:		Lower threshold - values less than this will be
			excluded.

	relative:	If set, the max and min arguments will be taken as 
			fractions of the maximum value in the array.

  OUTPUT: NONE


 RETURN: NONE


 SIDE EFFECTS:
	The input argument object_ps is modified.


 RESTRICTIONS:
	xx


 PROCEDURE:
	The thresholding is performed by cc_threshold.  See the documentation
	for that routine for details.
