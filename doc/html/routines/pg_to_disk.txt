PG_TO_DISK


 PURPOSE:
       Converts image coordinates to disk plane coordinates.  Input
       array can be array of image points or a pg_points_struct.


 CATEGORY:
	NV/PG


 CALLING SEQUENCE:
       result = pg_to_disk(image_points, cd=cd, dkx=dkx) 
       result = pg_to_disk(image_points, gd=gd)


 ARGUMENTS:
  INPUT:
        image_points:     Array (n_points) of image points (x,y) or
                          array of type pg_points_struct.

  OUTPUT:
       NONE

 KEYWORDS:
  INPUT:
                  cd:     Array (n_timesteps) of camera descriptors.

                 dkx:     Array (n_objects, n_timesteps) of descriptors of
                          objects that must be a subclass of DISK.

                  gd:     Generic descriptor.  If given, the cd and dkx
                          inputs are taken from the cd and dkx fields of 
                          this structure instead of from those keywords.

                  ps:     If set, image_points is treated as a structure
                          of type pg_points_struct.

  OUTPUT:
        NONE

 RETURN:
	Array (n_points) of disk points (radius and longitude).

 STATUS:
	Completed.
