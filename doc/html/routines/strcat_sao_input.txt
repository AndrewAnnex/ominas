STRCAT_SAO_INPUT


 PURPOSE:
        Input translator for SAO star catalog.


 CATEGORY:
       NV/CONFIG


 CALLING SEQUENCE(only to be called by nv_get_value):
       result = strcat_sao_input(dd, keyword)


 ARGUMENTS:
  INPUT:
	dd:		Data descriptor.

	keyword:	String giving the name of the translator quantity.

  OUTPUT:
       NONE

 KEYWORDS:
  INPUT:
	key1:		Observer descriptor, must be of subclass CAMERA.

  OUTPUT:
	status:		Zero if valid data is returned.

	n_obj:		Number of objects returned.

	dim:		Dimensions of return objects.


  TRANSLATOR KEYWORDS:
 	jtime:		Years since 1950 (the epoch of catalog) for precession
			and proper motion correction.  If not given, it is taken
			from the object descriptor bod_time, which is assumed to
			be seconds past 1950 unless keyword /j2000 is set.

	j2000:		If set, coordinates are output wrt j2000.

	b1950:		If set, coordinates are output wrt b1950.

	path_sao:	The directory of the star catalog, sao_idl.str.   
			In the file, the data is grouped into 18 segments of 
			10 degrees each.  Each star has a data record of 36
			bytes.  RA (radians), RAMu (pm in sec time/year)
			DEC (radians), DECMu (pm in sec arc/year)
			Visual Magnitude,  13-byte Name and 3-byte Spectral type
			The first 4 records of the output catalog are 18 sets
			of pointers to the records for the start and end of
			each segment.
			The real values (RA, RAMu, DEC, DECMu and Mag) are in
			XDR.  The pointer integers are in network byte order.

	faint:		Stars with magnitudes fainter than this will not be
			returned.

	bright:		Stars with magnitudes brighter than this will not be
			returned.


  ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES:
	NV_SAO_DATA:	Directory containing the SAO catalog data unless
			overridden using the path_sao translator keyword.


 RETURN:
       Star descriptor containing all the stars found.

 RESTRICTIONS:
       Since the distance to stars are not given in the SAO catalog, the
       position vector magnitude is set as 10 parsec and the luminosity
       is calculated from the visual magnitude and the 10 parsec distance.


 PROCEDURE:
       Stars are found in a square area in RA and DEC around a given
       or calculated center.  The star descriptor is filled with stars
       that fit in this area.  If J2000 is selected, input RA, DEC and/or
	ods orient matrix is assumed to be J2000 also, if not, input is
	assumed to be B1950, like the catalog.
