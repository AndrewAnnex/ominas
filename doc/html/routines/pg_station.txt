PG_STATION


 PURPOSE:
	Computes image points for given station descriptors.


 CATEGORY:
	NV/PG


 CALLING SEQUENCE:
	station_ps = pg_station(gd=gd)


 ARGUMENTS:
  INPUT: NONE

  OUTPUT: NONE


 KEYWORDS:
  INPUT:
	cd:	Array (n_timesteps) of camera descriptors.

	std:	Array (n_objects, n_timesteps) of descriptors of objects 
		that must be a subclass of STATION.

	gbx:	Array (n_xd, n_timesteps) of descriptors of objects 
		that must be a subclass of GLOBE.

	dkx:	Array (n_xd, n_timesteps) of descriptors of objects 
		that must be a subclass of DISK.

	bx:	Array (n_xd, n_timesteps) of descriptors of objects 
		that must be a subclass of BODY, instead of gbx or dkx.  

	frame_bd:	Subclass of BODY giving the frame against which to 
			measure inclinations and nodes, e.g., a planet 
			descriptor.  One per bx.

	gd:	Generic descriptor.  If given, the cd and gbx inputs 
		are taken from the cd and gbx fields of this structure
		instead of from those keywords.

	fov:	 If set points are computed only within this many camera
		 fields of view.

	cull:	 If set, points structures excluded by the fov keyword
		 are not returned.  Normally, empty points structures
		 are returned as placeholders.


  OUTPUT: NONE


 RETURN:
	Array (n_objects) of pg_points_struct containing image points and
	the corresponding inertial vectors.
