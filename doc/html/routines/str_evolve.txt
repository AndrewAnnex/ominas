STR_EVOLVE


 PURPOSE:
	Computes new star descriptors at the given time offsets from the 
	given star descriptors using the taylor series expansion 
	corresponding to the derivatives contained in the given star 
	descriptor.


 CATEGORY:
	NV/LIB/STR


 CALLING SEQUENCE:
	sdt = str_evolve(sx, dt)


 ARGUMENTS:
  INPUT: 
	sx:	 Any subclass of STAR.

	dt:	 Time offset.

  OUTPUT: NONE


 KEYWORDS:
  INPUT: 
	nodv:	 If set, derivatives will not be evolved.


  OUTPUT: NONE


 RETURN:
	Array (nsd,ndt) of newly allocated descriptors, of class STAR,
	evolved by time dt, where nsd is the number of sx, and ndt
	is the number of dt.


 STATUS:
	Complete
