PG_RING_SECTOR_OBLIQUE

 PURPOSE:
	Allows the user to select a ring sector by clicking and dragging.
	The top and bottom of the sector are defined along lines of constant 
	radius, while the sides are perpendicular to the image-projected
	radial direction.
 
 CATEGORY:
       NV/PG

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
     outline_ps=pg_ring_sector_oblique(cd=cd, dkx=dkx, gbx=gbx)


 ARGUMENTS:
  INPUT:
      NONE

  OUTPUT:
	NONE



 KEYWORDS:
  INPUT: 
           cd:     Camera descriptor.

	   dkx:     Disk descriptor describing the ring.

          gbx:     Globe descriptor giving the primary for the ring.

           gd:     Generic descriptor containnig the above descriptors.

      win_num:     Window number of IDL graphics window in which to select
                   box, default is current window.

      restore:     Do not leave the box in the image.

           p0:     First corner of box.  If set, then the routine immediately 
                   begins to drag from that point until a button is released.

        color:     Color to use for rectangle, default is !color.

        slope:     This keyword allows the longitude to vary from the
                   perpendicular direction as a function of radius as: 
                   lon = slope*(rad - rad0).

 xor_graphics:     If set, the sector outline is drawn and erased using xor
                   graphics instead of a pixmap.

    noverbose:     If set, messages are suppressed.

       sample:     Grid sampling, default is 1.

        nodsk:     If set, image points will not be included in the output 
                   pg_points_struct.

  OUTPUT:
         NONE


 RETURN: 
      pg_points_struct containing points on the sector outline.  The point
      spacing is determined by the sample keyword.  The points structure
      also contains the disk coordinate for each point and the user fields
      'nrad' and 'nlon' giving the number of points in radius and longitude.
