POWER_MATRIX


 PURPOSE:
       Constructs an array of n x n matrices such that the (i,j)th element
       of the kth matrix is:
                                  i    j
                   M(i,j,k) = p(k) q(k)

 CATEGORY:
       UTIL


 CALLING SEQUENCE:
       result = power_matrix(p, q, n)


 ARGUMENTS:
