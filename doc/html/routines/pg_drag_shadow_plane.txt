 PURPOSE:
	Allows the user to graphically rotate a plane passing through the 
	center of a planet by dragging the shadow cast by the planet on the
	plane using the mouse.


 CATEGORY:
	NV/PG


 CALLING SEQUENCE:
	dxy = pg_drag_shadow_plane(cd=cd, gbx=gbx, sund=sund)


 ARGUMENTS:
  INPUT: NONE

  OUTPUT: NONE


 KEYWORDS:
  INPUT:
	cd:	 Camera descriptor.

	gbx:	 Subclass of GLOBE.

	sund:	 Star descriptor for the Sun.

	gd:	 Generic descriptor.  If given, the cd, gbx, and sund inputs 
		 are taken from this structure instead of from those keywords.

	p0:	 Initial point to use instead  of prompting the user.

	n0:	 Initial plane orientation.  Default is the planet y-axis.

	gain:	 Radians / pixel offset from the initial point.

	axis:	 Rotation axis; default is the planet pole.

	noverbose:	If set, turns off notifications.

	xor_graphics:	If set, grahics are drawn using the XOR function.

	color:		Drawing color.
