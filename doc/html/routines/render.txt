 PURPOSE:
	Performs rendering on an array of bodies.


 CATEGORY:

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
	map = render(cd=cd, bx=bx, sund=sund)



 ARGUMENTS:
  INPUT: NONE
	image_pts:    Array of the image points defining the grid to be traced.  

  OUTPUT: NONE
	image_pts:    Array of the image points giving the grid that was traced.  


 KEYWORDS:
  INPUT:
	cd:	      Camera descriptor.

	bx:	      Array of object descriptors; must be a subclass of BODY.

	sund:         Star descriptor for the Sun.

	md:           Array of map descriptors, one for each body.

	ddmap:        Array of data descriptors containing the body maps, 
	              one for each body.

	sample:       Amount by which to subsample pixels.

	pc_size:      To save memory, the projection is performed in pieces
	              of this size.  Default is 65536.

	penumbra:     If set, lighting rays are traced to random points on 
	              each secondary body rather then the center.

	no_secondary: If set, no secondary ray tracing is performed, so 
	              resulting in no shadows.
