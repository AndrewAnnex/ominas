PERIM_INTERP


 PURPOSE:
	Interpolates within given ellipses in an image.


 CATEGORY:
	UTIL


 CALLING SEQUENCE:
	result = perim_interp(image, center_pts, a, b, h)


 ARGUMENTS:
  INPUT:
	image:		Input image.

	center_pts:	Array (2,n) giving ellipse centers.

	a:		Scalar giving the semimajor axis of the ellipses.

	b:		Scalar giving the semiminor axis of the ellipses.

	h:		Scalar giving the rotation of the ellipse semimajor axes
			from horizontal.  (radians)

  OUTPUT:
	NONE


 KEYWORDS:
  INPUT:
	show:		If set, the outlines of the ellipses are plotted on 
			the current graphics window.

  OUTPUT:
	NONE


 RETURN:
	Image array in which the pixels contained in the specified ellipses
	havwe been interpolated from the pixels along the perimeters of the 
	ellipses.


 PROCEDURE:
	Each point in each ellipse is replaced by an average of the points on
	the perimeter, weighted by the inverse square of the point's distance
	from each perimeter point.
