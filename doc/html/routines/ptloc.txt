PTLOC


 PURPOSE:
       To locate a point in an image that best fits a psf model.


 CATEGORY:
       UTIL


 CALLING SEQUENCE:
       result = ptloc(image, model, width)


 ARGUMENTS:
  INPUT:
       image:  Image, or subimage in which to find the point.
               Size of image should be at least width + size of model.

       model:  Model of the point spread function.

       width:  Width of box around calculated point in which to
               find the point.

  OUTPUT:
	sigma:	Position uncertainty.

         ccp:  The correlation coefficient at the point found.


 RETURN:
       The point (x,y) in the image that best fits the model.


 PROCEDURE:
       The correlation between the image and the model is calculated.  
	If possible, a gaussian is fit to the correlation peak and the
	sub-pixel location of the center of the gaussian is the result.  
	If that fit does not converge, then the location of the pixel with
	the maximum correlation is returned and a warning is printed.


 STATUS:
       Completed.
