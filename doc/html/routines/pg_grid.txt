PG_GRID


 PURPOSE:
	Computes image points on a surface coordinate grid.


 CATEGORY:
	NV/PG


 CALLING SEQUENCE:
	grid_ps = pg_grid(cd=cd, gbx=gbx)
	grid_ps = pg_grid(gd=gd)


 ARGUMENTS:
  INPUT: NONE

  OUTPUT: NONE


 KEYWORDS:
  INPUT:
	cd:	Array (n_timesteps) of camera descriptors.

	gbx:	Array (n_objects, n_timesteps) of descriptors of objects 
		that must be a subclass of GLOBE.

	dkx:	Array (n_objects, n_timesteps) of descriptors of objects 
		that must be a subclass of DISK.

	bx:	Array (n_objects, n_timesteps) of descriptors of objects 
		that must be a subclass of BODY.

	frame_bd:	Subclass of BODY giving the frame against which to 
			measure inclinations and nodes, e.g., a planet 
			descriptor.  One per bx.

	gd:	Generic descriptor.  If given, the cd and gbx inputs 
		are taken from the cd and gbx fields of this structure
		instead of from those keywords.

	lat:	Array giving grid-line latitudes in radians.

	lon:	Array giving grid-line longitudes in radians.

	nlat:	Number of equally-spaced latitude lines to generate if keyword
		lat not given.  Default is 12.

	flat:	This reference latitude line will be one of the latitude lines generated 
		if nlat is specified.  Default is zero.

	nlon:	Number of equally-spaced longitude lines to generate if keyword
		lon not given.  Default is 12.

	flon:	This reference longitude line will be one of the longitude lines generated 
		if nlon is specified.  Default is zero.

	fov:	 If set points are computed only within this many camera
		 fields of view.

	cull:	 If set, points structures excluded by the fov keyword
		 are not returned.  Normally, empty points structures
		 are returned as placeholders.

	npoints: Number of points to compute in each latitude or longitude line,
		 per 2*pi radians; default is 360.

	slat:	Latitudes to compute on each longitude circle.

	slon:	Longitudes to compute on each latitude circle.


  OUTPUT: 
	lat:	Array giving grid-line latitudes in radians.

	lon:	Array giving grid-line longitudes in radians.


 RETURN:
	Array (n_objects) of pg_points_struct containing image points and
	the corresponding inertial vectors.
