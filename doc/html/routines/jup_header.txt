JUP_HEADER


 PURPOSE:
	To create ominas detached header files from Cassini Jupiter era
	images using a FORTRAN program to interface to SPICE.

 CATEGORY:
	UTIL/SPICE

 USAGE:
	jup_header, filename

 ARGUMENTS:
	filename:	Cassini VICAR image

 RESTRICTIONS:
	This is a basic implementation.  It creates a detached header
	with a Camera descriptor, Ring descriptor, Star descriptor for
	the Sun and 5 planet descriptors of Jupiter, Io, Europa, Ganymede
	and Callisto.  If the TARGET_NAME of the observation in the
	label is not one of these, then a planet descriptor of the target
	object is also made.  Dimensions use meters and meters/sec.  Time is
	Ephemeris time (close to seconds past J2000).  Coordinate system
	for Position and velocity and orientation matricies is J2000.
	NAIF kernel names are named in a file jup_header.kernels.  If new
	kernels are received, this file will have to be modified with the
	new kernel names.

       If no C kernel is available, the orientation matrix is set so
	that the optic axis points torward the TARGET_NAME in the label.
	and has the planets pole axis aligned in the line direction, with
	North in the direction of decreasing line number.
