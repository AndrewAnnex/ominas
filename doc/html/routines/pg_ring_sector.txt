PG_RING_SECTOR

 PURPOSE:
	Allows the user to select a ring sector by clicking and dragging.
	With the left button, the sector is defined along lines of constant 
	radius and longitude.  With the right button, the sides of the sector
	are perpendicular to the projected radial direction.
 
 CATEGORY:
       NV/PG

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
     rad=pg_ring_sector(cd=cd, dkx=dkx, gbx=gbx)


 ARGUMENTS:
  INPUT:
      NONE

  OUTPUT:
	NONE



 KEYWORDS:
  INPUT: 
           cd:     Camera descriptor.

	   dkx:     Disk descriptor describing the ring.

          gbx:     Globe descriptor giving the primary for the ring.

           gd:     Generic descriptor containnig the above descriptors.

      win_num:     Window number of IDL graphics window in which to select
                   box, default is current window.

      restore:     Do not leave the box in the image.

           p0:     First corner of box.  If set, then the routine immediately 
                   begins to drag from that point until a button is released.

        color:     Color to use for rectangle, default is !color.

        slope:     This keyword allows the longitude to vary from the
                   nominal direction as a function of radius as: 
                   lon = slope*(rad - rad0).

       sample:     Sets the grid sampling in pixels.  Default is one.

 xor_graphics:     If set, the sector outline is drawn and erased using xor
                   graphics instead of a pixmap.

        nodsk:     If set, image points will not be included in the output 
                   pg_points_struct.

    noverbose:     If set, messages are suppressed.

      rad,lon:     If set, these values are used as bounds for the ring 
                   the ring sector instead of pronpting the user. 


  OUTPUT:
       button:     Code of the detected button.


 RETURN: 
      pg_points_struct containing points on the sector outline.  The point
      spacing is determined by the sample keyword.  The points structure
      also contains the disk coordinate for each point and the user fields
      'nrad' and 'nlon' giving the number of points in radius and longitude.


 MODIFICATION HISTORY : 
	J. Spitale ; 5/2005 -- Original pg_ring_sector renamed 
	                       pg_ring_sector_rad; this program created.
