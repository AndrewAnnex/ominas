GAUSS2_FUNCT
 PURPOSE:
	Evaluate function for gauss2fit.
 CALLING SEQUENCE:
	FUNCT,X,A,F,PDER
 INPUTS:
	X = values of independent variables, encoded as: [nx, ny, x, y]
	A = parameters of equation described below.
 OUTPUTS:
	F = value of function at each X(i,j), Y(i,j).
	Function is:
		F(x,y) = A0 + A1*EXP(-U/2)
		where: U= (yp/A2)^2 + (xp/A3)^2

	  If A has 7 elements a rotation of the ellipse is present and:
		xp = (x-A4) * cos(A6) - (y-A5) * sin(A6)
		yp = (x-A4) * sin(A6) + (y-A5) * cos(A6)
	  If A has 6 elements, A6 (theta) is 0, the major and minor axes
	  of the ellipse are parallel to the XY axes, and:
		xp = (x-A4)   and   yp = (x-A5)

 Optional output parameters:
	PDER = (n_elements(z),6 or 7) array containing the
		partial derivatives.  pder(i,j) = derivative
		at ith point w/respect to jth parameter.
 PROCEDURE:
	Evaluate the function and then if requested, eval partials.
