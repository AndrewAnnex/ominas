PG_CVSCAN_COEFF


 PURPOSE:
	Computes linear least-squares coefficients for a fit to the image
	coordinate translation and rotation that matches a computed curve to
	a scanned curve in an image.


 CATEGORY:
	NV/PG


 CALLING SEQUENCE:
	scan_cf = pg_cvscan_coeff(scan_ps, axis_ps=axis_ps)


 ARGUMENTS:
  INPUT:
	scan_ps:	Array (n_curves) of pg_points_struct output from
			pg_cvscan containing scanned image points as well as
			other necessary scan data.

  OUTPUT: NONE


 KEYWORDS:
  INPUT:
	axis_ps:	pg_points_struct containing a single image  point
			to be used as the axis of rotation in the fit for
			every curve.

	fix:		Array specifying which parameters to fix in the
			fit as [dx,dy,dtheta].

  OUTPUT: NONE


 RETURN:
	Array (n_curves) of pg_fit_coeff_struct containing coefficients for 
	the least-square fit to be input to pg_fit.


 RESTRICTIONS:
	Currently does not work for multiple time steps.


 PROCEDURE:
	pg_cvscan_coeff extracts the scan data from the given
	scan_ps structure and uses icv_coeff to compute the coefficients.  
	See the documentation for that routine for details.


 EXAMPLE:
	The following command uses scan data from pg_cvscan to compute
	least square coefficients for a fit such that only dx and dtheta
	will be allowed to vary: 

	cvscan_cf = pg_cvscan_coeff(scan_ps, axis=center_ps, fix=[1])

	In this call, scan_ps is a pg_points_struct containing the scan data
	from pg_cvscan and center_ps is a pg_points_struct giving the center
	of the planet as computed by pg_center.


 STATUS:
	Complete
