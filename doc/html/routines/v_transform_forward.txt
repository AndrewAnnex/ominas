V_TRANSFORM_FORWARD


 PURPOSE:
       Transforms vectors given rotation matrices and translation vectors.


 CATEGORY:
       UTIL/V


 CALLING SEQUENCE:
       result = v_transform_forward(M, p, v)


 ARGUMENTS:
  INPUT:
       M:      array of nt (nel x nel) rotation matrices

       p:      array of nt nel-element column vectors

       v:      v is array (nv,nel,nt) of nel-element column vectors

  OUTPUT:
       NONE

 RETURN:
       Array (nv,nel,nt) of nel-element transformed column vectors.

 PROCEDURE:
       Vectors are first rotated using M and then translated using p.

 STATUS:
       Completed.
