	comments.


 CATEGORY:
	UTIL


 CALLING SEQUENCE:
	text = read_txt_file(fname, notes)


 ARGUMENTS:
  INPUT:
	fname:	Name of the file to read.

  OUTPUT: 
	notes:  Array of strings giving note text for each line.  This text is taken
		from the 'note' input.


 KEYWORDS:
  INPUT: 
	start:	If given, the returned text begins at the first line
		in which this string appears.  Default is '--begin--'.

	stop:	If given, the returned text ends at the first line
		in which this string appears.  Default is '--end--'.

       note:	If this string appears in the file, this line is used as the note 
		for each returned line until this string appears again, and so on.
		Default is '--note--'.

	raw:	If set, the 'start' and 'stop' keywords are ignored.
		Comments are also not removed.

	all:	If set, the 'start' and 'stop' keywords are ignored.

	sample:	If set, only every nth line is returned, where n is the value
		of this keyword; the first line is always returned.  If there 
		are notes, then this operation applies separately to each block 
		of lines with the same note.

	select: If set, only lines with the given note string will be returned.
		

  OUTPUT:
	status:	0 if successful, -1 if file not found

	String array containing the text read from the file.  Unless /raw
	is specified, the returned text will not contain any characters
	appearing after the comment character '#', and the start and stop
	directoves are used to select the return block of text.
