RNG_EVOLVE


 PURPOSE:
	Computes new ring descriptors at the given time offsets from the 
	given ring descriptors using the taylor series expansion 
	corresponding to the derivatives contained in the given ring 
	descriptor.


 CATEGORY:
	NV/LIB/RNG


 CALLING SEQUENCE:
	rdt = rng_evolve(rx, dt)


 ARGUMENTS:
  INPUT: 
	rx:	 Any subclass of RING.

	dt:	 Time offset.

  OUTPUT: NONE


 KEYWORDS:
  INPUT: 
	nodv:	 If set, derivatives will not be evolved.


  OUTPUT: NONE


 RETURN:
	Array (nrd,ndt) of newly allocated descriptors, of class RING,
	evolved by time dt, where nrd is the number of rx, and ndt
	is the number of dt.


 STATUS:
	Complete
