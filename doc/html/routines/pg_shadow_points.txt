PG_SHADOW_POINTS


 PURPOSE:
	Determines whether each given point is shadowed by the given object.


 CATEGORY:
	NV/PG


 CALLING SEQUENCE:
	pg_shadow_points, object_ps, cd=cd, od=od, bx=bx


 ARGUMENTS:
  INPUT:
	object_ps:	Array of pg_points_struct containing inertial vectors
			to shadow.

  OUTPUT: 
	shadow_ps:	Array of pg_points_struct containing the shadowed
			points.


 KEYWORDS:
  INPUT:
	cd:	Array (n_timesteps) of camera descriptors.

	bx:	Array (nbx, n_timesteps) of descriptors of objects 
		which must be a subclass of BODY describing the shadowing
		bodies.

	od:	Array (n_timesteps) of descriptors of objects 
		which must be a subclass of BODY.  These objects are used
		as the source from which points are projected.  If no observer
		descriptor is given, then the sun descriptor in gd is used.
		Only one observer is allowed.

	gd:	Generic descriptor.  If given, the cd and bx inputs 
		are taken from the corresponding fields of this structure
		instead of from those keywords.

	fov:	 If set shadow points are cropped to within this many camera
		 fields of view.

	cull:	 If set, points structures excluded by the fov keyword
		 are not returned.  Normally, empty points structures
		 are returned as placeholders.

   backshadow:	 If set, only backshadows (shadows cast between the object and
 		 observer) are considered.

	both:	 If set, both shadows and backshadows are returned.

	edge:	 If set, only points near the edge of the shadow are returned.

  OUTPUT: NONE


 RETURN: NONE


 SIDE EFFECTS:
	Shadowed points are flagged as invisible.
