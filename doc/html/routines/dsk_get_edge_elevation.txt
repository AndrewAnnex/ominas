DSK_GET_EDGE_ELEVATION


 PURPOSE:
	Computes elevations along the edge of a disk.


 CATEGORY:
	NV/LIB/DSK


 CALLING SEQUENCE:
	z = dsk_get_edge_elevation(dkx, lon, frame_bd)


 ARGUMENTS:
  INPUT:
	dkx:	 Array (nt) of any subclass of DISK.

	lon:	 Array (nlon) of longitudes at which to compute elevations.

	frame_bd:	Subclass of BODY giving the frame against which to 
			measure inclinations and nodes, e.g., a planet 
			descriptor.  One for each dkx.

  OUTPUT: NONE


 KEYWORDS:
  INPUT:  
	inner:	If set, the inner edge is used.

	outer:	If set, the outer edge is used.

  OUTPUT: NONE


 RETURN:
	Array (nt x nlon) of elevations computed at each longitude on each 
	disk.
