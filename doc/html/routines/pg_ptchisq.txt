PG_PTCHISQ


 PURPOSE:
	Computes chi-squared value for given point fit parameters.


 CATEGORY:
	NV/PG


 CALLING SEQUENCE:
	chisq = pg_ptchisq(dxy, dtheta, scan_ps, axis_ps=axis_ps)


 ARGUMENTS:
  INPUT:
	dxy:		2-element vector giving the translation as [dx,dy].

	dtheta:		Rotation in radians.

	scan_ps:	Array (n_points) of pg_points_struct output from
			pg_ptscan containing scanned image points as well as
			other necessary scan data.

  OUTPUT: NONE


 KEYWORDS:
  INPUT:
	axis_ps:	pg_points_struct containing a single image  point
			to be used as the axis of rotation.

	fix:		Array specifying which parameters to fix as
			[dx,dy,dtheta].

  OUTPUT: NONE


 RETURN:
	Single chi-square values for totality of points.


 RESTRICTIONS:
	The caller is responsible for ensuring that the input parameters are
	consistent with those used with other programs like pg_fit.


 STATUS:
	Complete
