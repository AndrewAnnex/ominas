GRIM_MAG_MODE_EVENT


 PURPOSE:
	Allows user to save the current image plane and geometry.  If there 
	is no current filename for the current plane, then the user is 
	prompted for one.  All descriptors are written through the translators
	and then nv_write is used to write the data file.  Specific behavior 
	is governed by MINAS' configuration.
