PG_DRAW_POINT


 PURPOSE:
	Draws points from the given pg_points_struct on the current graphics
	window using the current data coordinate system.


 CATEGORY:
	NV/PG


 CALLING SEQUENCE:
	pg_draw_point, object_ps


 ARGUMENTS:
  INPUT:
	object_ps:	Array of pg_points_struct containing image points
			to be plotted in the current data coordinate system.

  OUTPUT: NONE


 KEYWORDS:
  INPUT:
	literal:	All of the following input keywords accept an array
			where each element corresponds to an element in the
			object_ps array.  By default, if the keyword array is
			shorter than the object_ps array, then the last element
	  		is used to fill out the array.  /literal suppresses
			this behavior and causes unspecified elements to
			take their default values.

	colors:		Array of plotting colors.  Default is !color.  String
			names will be converted using the ct<string>()
			functions.  Labels are also plotted in this color.
			If one element, then all points are plotted in this
			color; if multiple elements, and object_ps also
			has multiple elements, each color will be assigned to 
			all elements in the corresponding array (see /literal);
			if mulitple elements, and object_ps has only one
			element, then each color will be assigned to each 
			element of th object_ps array.

	shades:		Array of plotting shades.  Default is 1.0.

	label_shade:	Array of plotting shades for labels.  Default is 1.0.

	shades:		Array of plotting shades.  Default is 1.0.

	psyms:		Array of plotting symbols.  Default is 3.

	thick:		Array of plotting thicknesses.  Default is 1.

	line:		Array of linestyles.  Default is 0.

	psizes:		Array of plotting symbol sizes.  Default is 1.0.

	csizes:		Array of character sizes.  Default is 1.0.

	cthicks:	Array of character thicknesses.  Default is 1.0.

	corient:	Array of character orientations.  Default is 1.0.

	plabels:	Array of object labels.  Default is ''. 

	label_points:	If set, plabels will be applied element-by-element to
			each point in each points array instead of once
			to each object.

	align:		Label alignment.  See XYOUTS.

	wnum:		Window number in which to draw.

	xormode:	If set, XOR graphics mode is used for drawing.

	print:		Message to print before plotting.

  OUTPUT: NONE


 RETURN:
	NONE


 EXAMPLE:
	The following command draws and labels a lavender 'limb' and a red
	'ring' (assuming that the points have already been computed):

	pg_draw_point, [limb_ps, ring_ps], color=[ctpurple(), ctred()], $
	         plabels=['LIMB','RING']
