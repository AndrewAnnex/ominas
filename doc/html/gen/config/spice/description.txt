SPICE Translator Package
========================

 The purpose of the OMINAS SPICE interface is to allow SPICE kernels to be
 directly read into and written from OMINAS via input and output translators. 
 Because SPICE kernels are mission-dependent (the exact layout of the C-matrix
 depends on the camera in question, for example), unique input and output
 translators must be written for each mission supported.  Translators and
 supporting routines for each mission reside in subdirectories whose names are
 abbreviations of the mission name, for example 'cas' or 'gll'.

 The generic portion of the OMINAS SPICE interface consists of one IDL program
 and one dynamically-linked C program each for input and output actions.  The
 IDL routines are structured similarly to standard OMINAS input and output
 translators, but they require a mission-dependent wrapper in order to be used
 as actual OMINAS translators.  The compiled C routines interact directly with
 the SPICE kernels using cspice, the C version of NAIFLIB.  

 The SPICE input translator core, spice_input, reads all of the SPICE spacecraft
 and planetary ephemeris data and returns the appropriate descriptors.  The
 SPICE output translator core, spice_output, currently recognizes only camera
 descriptors, writing only a C-kernel containing any number of C matrices.

 Currently Cassini and Galileo are supported by the SPICE interface.  To add
 support for other missions, model your code after the programs in the
 ${NV_SPICE}/cas or ${NV_SPICE}/gll directories.
