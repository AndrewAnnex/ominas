READPDS_4.0 Program Reference
=============================

 Summary
 -------
  - BTABVECT        (BINARY - TABLE - TO - VECTOR)
       Extract the desired column vector from a binary table saved in a
       2 dimensional IDL byte array

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
       Result=BTABVECT(table, start, bytes, type [,elements])

 INPUTS:
       table = a 2 dimensional byte array containing the unconverted 'raw'
       data from a binary table.

       start = the starting byte of the desired column vector 

       bytes = the number of bytes in the desired column vector

       type = the data type (BYTE,INTEGER,UNSIGNED_INTEGER,REAL,FLOAT,
       DOUBLE,BOOLEAN,TIME,DATE or CHARACTER) of the desired column vector

 OPTIONAL INPUT:
	ELEMENTS - number of elements across if column to be extracted is
		a 2 dimensional array. Defaults to 1. 

 OUTPUTS:
       Result = column vector of type defined by the particular column header,
       extracted from the binary table.

 EXAMPLE:
       Extract the column vector that starts at byte 0, is 2 bytes long, 
       and is of type 'INTEGER' from a PDS binary table saved in the variable
       table, and return it as an integer array, named vect. 

               IDL> vect = BTABVECT(table,0,2,'INTEGER')
 WARNINGS:
       This version of BTABVECT does not handle COMPLEX numbers yet. That
       capability will be added later.

READPDS
-------

 PURPOSE: 
	Reads a PDS file into IDL data and label variables.

 CATEGORY:
	UTIL/PDS

 CALLING SEQUENCE: 
	Result = READPDS (Filename [,/SILENT])

 ARGUMENTS:
  INPUT:
    Filename: Scalar string containing the name of the PDS file to read

  OUTPUT:
    Result: PDS data structure constructed from designated record

 KEYWORDS:
  INPUT:
    SILENT: suppresses any message from the procedure

 EXAMPLES:
    To read a PDS file TEST.LBL into an IDL image array, img:
       IDL> img = READPDS ("TEST.LBL",/SILENT)
       IDL> help, /STRUCTURE, img
            OBJECTS      INT       1
            IMAGE        LONG     [200,200]
    To read a PDS file with multiple objects:
       IDL> data = READPDS ("MULTIPLE.LBL",/SILENT)
       IDL> help, /STRUCTURE, data
            OBJECTS      INT       2
            TABLE        STRUCT    -> ARRAY[1]
            IMAGE        STRUCT    -> ARRAY[1]
