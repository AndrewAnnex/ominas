DAWN_SPICE_INPUT
----------------


 PURPOSE:
	NAIF/SPICE input translator for Dawn. 


 CATEGORY:
	NV/CONFIG


 CALLING SEQUENCE:
	result = dawn_spice_input(dd, keyword)


 ARGUMENTS:
  INPUT:
	dd:		Data descriptor.

	keyword:	String giving the name of the translator quantity.


  OUTPUT:
	NONE


 KEYWORDS:
  INPUT:
	key1:		Camera descriptor.

  OUTPUT:
	status:		Zero if valid data is returned.

	n_obj:		Number of objects returned.

	dim:		Dimensions of return objects.


  TRANSLATOR KEYWORDS:
	ref:		Name of the reference frame for the output quantities.
			Default is 'j2000'.

	j2000:		/j2000 is equivalent to specifying ref=j2000.

	b1950:		/b1950 is equivalent to specifying ref=b1950.

	klist:		Name of a file giving a list of SPICE kernels to use.
			If no path is included, the path is taken from the 
			NV_SPICE_KER environment variable.

	ck_in:		List of input C kernel files to use.  List must be 
			delineated by semimcolons with no space.  The kernel
			list file is still used, but these kernels take
			precedence.  Entries in this list may be file
			specification strings.

	planets:	List of planets to for which to request ephemeris.  
			Must be delineated by semicolons with no space.

	reload:		If set, new kernels are loaded, as specified by the
			klist and ck_in keywords.


 RETURN:
	Data associated with the requested keyword.


 STATUS:
	Complete

 CALLING SEQUENCE(only to be called by nv_xx_value):
	dawn_spice_output, dd, keyword, value


 ARGUMENTS:
  INPUT:
	dd:		Data descriptor.

	keyword:	String giving the name of the translator quantity.

	value:		The data to write.

  OUTPUT:
	NONE


 KEYWORDS:
  INPUT:
	key1:		Camera descriptor.

  OUTPUT:
	status:		Zero unless a problem occurs.


  TRANSLATOR KEYWORDS:
	ref:		Name of the reference frame for the input quantities.
			Default is 'j2000'.

	j2000:		/j2000 is equivalent to specifying ref=j2000.

	b1950:		/b1950 is equivalent to specifying ref=b1950.

	ck_out:		String giving the name of the new C-kernel to write.


 STATUS:
	Complete
