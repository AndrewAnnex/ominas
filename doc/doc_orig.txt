DH_CAMERA
---------


 PURPOSE:
	In conjunction with the detached header routine, write out
	camera parameters.

       dh_camera, dh, label, et, c_matrix


 ARGUMENTS:
  INPUT:
             dh:     Detached header name
	   label:     Vicar label from image
	      et:     Ephemeris time
	c_matrix:     C-matrix from SPICE


  OUTPUT:
       NONE

 KEYWORDS:
  INPUT:
       NONE

  OUTPUT:
       NONE



 STATUS:
       Completed.

DH_RINGS
--------


 PURPOSE:
	To be called by the make dh header routines to fill the ring
	descriptor

 CATEGORY:
	UTIL/SPICE

 USAGE:
	dh_rings, dh, planet, et, pos, vel     

 ARGUMENTS:
	     dh:	Detatched header
	 planet:	Planet of ring system
	     et:	Ephemeris time
	    pos:	Position of main planet
	    vel:	Velocity of main planet

 RESTRICTIONS:
	This is a basic implementation only including one ring with the
	inner and outer edges defined by the range of the entire planetary
	ring system.  It does not include compenent rings including eccentric
	rings.  This routine will implement RINGS as the VICAR program
	NAV did some time in the future.

JUP_HEADER
----------


 PURPOSE:
	To create ominas detached header files from Cassini Jupiter era
	images using a FORTRAN program to interface to SPICE.

 CATEGORY:
	UTIL/SPICE

 USAGE:
	jup_header, filename

 ARGUMENTS:
	filename:	Cassini VICAR image

 RESTRICTIONS:
	This is a basic implementation.  It creates a detached header
	with a Camera descriptor, Ring descriptor, Star descriptor for
	the Sun and 5 planet descriptors of Jupiter, Io, Europa, Ganymede
	and Callisto.  If the TARGET_NAME of the observation in the
	label is not one of these, then a planet descriptor of the target
	object is also made.  Dimensions use meters and meters/sec.  Time is
	Ephemeris time (close to seconds past J2000).  Coordinate system
	for Position and velocity and orientation matricies is J2000.
	NAIF kernel names are named in a file jup_header.kernels.  If new
	kernels are received, this file will have to be modified with the
	new kernel names.

       If no C kernel is available, the orientation matrix is set so
	that the optic axis points torward the TARGET_NAME in the label.
	and has the planets pole axis aligned in the line direction, with
	North in the direction of decreasing line number.
