IPT_CHISQ
---------


 PURPOSE:
	Computes chi-squared value for given point fit parameters.


 CATEGORY:
	UTIL/NV/LIB/TOOLS/IPT


 CALLING SEQUENCE:
	result = ipt_chisq(dxy, dtheta, fix, pts_dx, pts_dy, pts)


 ARGUMENTS:
  INPUT:
	dxy:		Array (2) giving x- and y-offset solution.

	dtheta:		Scalar giving theta-offset solution.

	fix:		Array specifying which parameters to fix as
			[dx,dy,dtheta].

       pts_dx:         Array (n_points) containing offset of actual
                       point from predicted point in x.

       pts_dy:         Array (n_points) containing offset of actual
                       point from predicted point in y.

       pts:            Array (2,n_points) of image coordinates corresponding
                       to actual point.

	axis:		Array (2) giving image coordinates of rotation axis
			in the case of a 3-parameter fit.

  OUTPUT: NONE


 KEYWORDS: 
  INPUT:
	norm:		If set, the returned value is normalized by dividing
			it by the number of degrees of freedom.

  OUTPUT: NONE


 RETURN:
	The chi-squared value is returned.


 STATUS:
	Completed.

IPT_COEFF
---------


 PURPOSE:
	Computes coefficients for the 2- or 3-parameter linear least-square fit.


 CATEGORY:
	UTIL/NV/LIB/TOOLS/IPT


 CALLING SEQUENCE:
	ipt_coeff, pts_x, pts_y, pts, axis, M=M, b=b


 ARGUMENTS:
  INPUT:

	pts_x:	        Value containing offset of actual
			point from predicted point in x.

       pts_y:          Value containing offset of actual
                       point from predicted point in y.

	pts:	        Array (2) of image coordinates corresponding
			to actual point.

	axis:		Array (2) giving image coordinates of rotation axis
			in the case of a 3-parameter fit.

  OUTPUT: NONE


 KEYWORDS:
  INPUT: 
	sigma:	Uncertainty in each point position.

  OUTPUT:
	M:	3x3 matrix of coefficients for the linear fit.

	b:	3-element column vector rhs of the linear fit.


 PROCEDURE:
	Since the fit has been linearized, it can be written as a matrix
	equation:

				Mx = b,

	where x is the 3-element column vector [dx, dy, dtheta] of the
	independent variables. 	This routine computes the matrix M and the
	vector b.  Once these are known, mbfit can be used to solve the
	linear system.  Furthermore, since the fit is linear, a simultaneous
	fit can be performed by simply adding together any number of
	coefficient matrices and vectors, which can also be done using
	mbfit.


 RESTRICTIONS:
	The fit associated with these coefficients has been linearized
	and is only valid for small corrections.  For larger corrections,
	this procedure can be iterated.


 STATUS:
	Complete.
