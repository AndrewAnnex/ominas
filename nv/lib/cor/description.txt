CORE Object Class
=================

 The CORE object class is the superclass of all other object classes.
 The lowest-level fields of this class (sn and idp) are handled by nv/sys.  
 The reason for that cross functionality is that data descriptors (which are 
 not gemetric objects, and are part of nv/sys) also require that level of 
 management.  



Data objects
------------
 - core descriptor
	The core descriptor is the class structure for the CORE class.  
	See core_descriptor__define.


 - task list
	The core descriptor maintains a list of the names of every program 
	that has modified this descriptor.  A program that modifies the 
	descriptor should call cor_add_task to add its name to the list 
	immediately after it has modified the descriptor.  Tasks cannot be 
	removed from the list.


 - User data
	The core descriptor maintains a list of user-generated named
	data objects.
