DISK Object Class
=================

 The DISK object class describes the shapes of objects that are roughly
 disk-shaped.  Currently, it describes a flat object whose inner and outer 
 edges are keplarian ellipses, but this may be generalized in the future.  
 It is an immediate subclass of SOLID.

Coordinate systems
------------------
 - Inertial
	Cartesian coordinate system used as the celestial reference frame.

 - Body
	Cartesian coordinate system centered on and fixed to the body.  This
	coordinate system is inherited from BODY.

 - Disk
	Cylindrical coordinate system defined with respect to a disk. 
	Vectors are given as [radius, longitude, altitude] columns vectors
	with respect to the plane whose orientation and reference direction 
	are specified by the disk orientation matrix.  Disk longitude is zero 
	at the ascending node of the disk plane on the inertial x-y plane and 
	increases in a right-handed sense about the z-axis of the body
	orientation matrix.  The reference direction (X-axis of the orientation 
	matrix) points toward periapse.


Data objects
------------
 - orientation matrix
	The orientation matrix is inherited from BODY.  Th b2 axis corresponds
	to the normal to the plane of the disk and the b0 axis gives the
	periapse direction as shown.

			     / b0 -> periapse


 - position vector
	The position vector is inherited from BODY.  It gives the position of
	the disk center with respect to the inertial coordinate system.


 - disk descriptor
	The disk descriptor is the class structure for the DISK class.  
	See disk_descriptor__define.
