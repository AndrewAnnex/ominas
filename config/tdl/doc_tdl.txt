TDL Program Reference
=====================

 Summary
 -------
  - READ_TDL
	Reads a tdl data file.  This is essentially a VICAR file, except
	that the data are written in string form.

  - WRITE_TDL
	Writes a tab-delimited (tdl) text data file.  This is essentially
	a VICAR file, except that the data is written as tab-delimited
	text, suitable for reading into excel.  The label is written
	as the first line of the file.  You may need to use '.csv' file
	extensio for Excel to recognize the format.
