CREATE Program Reference
========================

 Summary
 -------
  - CONVERT_BCONS
	Create an IDL bcons file from the original VAX indexed file.
	The data are fixed length records of the form bcons, length
	165 bytes.  An index containing the planet and satellite number
	is also created.  The number is consistent with the SEDR target
	number (sat_num*10 + planet_num).

  - CONVERT_SEDR2
	Create an IDL sedr2 file from the original VAX indexed file.
	The data are fixed length records of the form sedr2, length
	134 bytes.  An index containing the sctime is also created.

  - CONVERT_SEDRUPD
	Create an IDL sedrupd file from the original VAX indexed file.
	The data are fixed length records of the form sedrupd, length
	84 bytes.  An index containing the sctime is also created.












































CONVERT_BCONS
-------------


 PURPOSE:
	Create an IDL bcons file from the original VAX indexed file.
	The data are fixed length records of the form bcons, length
	165 bytes.  An index containing the planet and satellite number
	is also created.  The number is consistent with the SEDR target
	number (sat_num*10 + planet_num).

 CATEGORY:
	UTIL/SEDR/CREATE


 CALLING SEQUENCE:
	convert_bcons


 ARGUMENTS:
  INPUT: NONE

  OUTPUT: NONE


 KEYWORDS:
  INPUT: NONE

  OUTPUT: NONE


 PROCEDURE:
	The IDL bcons file has its float and double entries in XDR
	format and its integers in Network byte order.  The conversion
	is done by the sedr_unpack_bcons procedure.  WRITEU is used to create
	the file instead of ASSOC since the structure is byte-padded
	differently on different platforms.  The original file is called
	BODYCONST.DAT, the output files are bodyconst.dat_idl data
	file and bodyconst.dat_idx index file.


 RESTRICTIONS: 
	This procedure is meant to be run on a VAX computer running OpenVMS
	where the original data file was hosted.  The file is then moved
	to another platform via FTP in binary mode.


 STATUS:
	Complete.

CONVERT_SEDR2
-------------


 PURPOSE:
	Create an IDL sedr2 file from the original VAX indexed file.
	The data are fixed length records of the form sedr2, length
	134 bytes.  An index containing the sctime is also created.


 CATEGORY:
	UTIL/SEDR/CREATE


 CALLING SEQUENCE:
	convert_sedr2, planet


 ARGUMENTS:
  INPUT:

	planet:		String containing the central body of the sedr2
			file.  planet can be one of 'jupiter', 'saturn',
			'uranus' or 'neptune'.

  OUTPUT: NONE


 KEYWORDS:
  INPUT: NONE

  OUTPUT: NONE


 PROCEDURE:
	The IDL sedr2 file has its float and double entries in XDR
	format and its integers in Network byte order.  The conversion
	is done by the sedr_unpack_sedr2 procedure.  WRITEU is used to create
	the file instead of ASSOC since the structure is byte-padded
	differently on different platforms.  The original file is called
	'PLANET'.SDR2, the output files are 'planet'.sdr2_idl data
	file and 'planet'.sdr2_idx index file.


 RESTRICTIONS: 
	This procedure is meant to be run on a VAX computer running OpenVMS
	where the original data file was hosted. The file is then moved
	to another platform via FTP in binary mode.

CONVERT_SEDRUPD
---------------


 PURPOSE:
	Create an IDL sedrupd file from the original VAX indexed file.
	The data are fixed length records of the form sedrupd, length
	84 bytes.  An index containing the sctime is also created.


 CATEGORY:
	UTIL/SEDR/CREATE


 CALLING SEQUENCE:
	convert_sedrupd, planet


 ARGUMENTS:
  INPUT:

	planet:		String containing the central body of the sedr2
			file.  planet can be one of 'jupiter', 'saturn',
			'uranus' or 'neptune'.

  OUTPUT: NONE


 KEYWORDS:
  INPUT: NONE

  OUTPUT: NONE


 PROCEDURE:
	The IDL sedrupd file has its float and double entries in XDR
	format and its integers in Network byte order.  The conversion
	is done by the sedr_unpack_sedrupd procedure.  WRITEU is used to create
	the file instead of ASSOC since the structure is byte-padded
	differently on different platforms.  The original file is called
	'PLANET'.SDRU, the output files are 'planet'.sdru_idl data
	file and 'planet'.sdru_idx index file.


 RESTRICTIONS: 
	This procedure is meant to be run on a VAX computer running OpenVMS
	where the original data file was hosted.  The file is then moved
	to another platform via FTP in binary mode.
